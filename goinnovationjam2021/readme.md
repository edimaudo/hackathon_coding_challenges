## Go Innovation Jam 2021

##The Challenge Statement
***
How might we help older adults stay in their homes longer while maintaining their independence in a safer, healthier, and more cost-effective way.


## Background
As we get older, life can become more challenging, from standing on our own, to getting around town, to staying in touch with family and friends. So, we’re calling on participants to use emerging technology to develop ideas that lead to long-term solutions for ageing in place.

The ageing process creates physical, mental and social challenges. The older we get; the more health issues crop up. Some are sudden and unexpected, some are chronic. We lose mobility. We retire and must adjust to a fixed income. We become more socially isolated. All the while, we have to maintain our bodies, minds, and homes while we age-in-place.  

With the right technology we can improve quality of life and that’s why we’re hosting this Innovation Jam. It’s an open call for solutions to common issues older adults face. 

### Key areas
- Stay independent: physical, mental, financial freedom
- Safes Spaces: Reduce environmental risk, support mobility
- Long term health: keep treatable issues in check, identify new risks early
- Social connections: sustain relationships between family and friends to maintain mental health


## Timeline
March 26 to April 22, 2021

1. Magnifying Glass With Light

Platforms: iPhone, iPad

Cost: Free

Description: As we age and our eyesight decreases, it becomes more difficult to see in general and to read small print. With this app, developed by Falcon in Motion, seniors can illuminate and magnify books, magazines, newspapers, restaurant menus and more from Apple products.

Staying Social

2. Skype

Platforms: Android, iPhone, iPad

Cost: Free

Description: Many families are spread out across the state, country and even internationally. Although they’re able to write letters or talk on the phone, nothing compares with face-to-face interaction. For that reason, our caregivers often set up Skype on their mobile device, computer or tablet so they can “see” each other by video conferencing. When our clients are able to see their children (or grandchildren) who don't live nearby, it not only makes their day, but also provides their grown kids with peace of mind seeing that their parents' care is being managed well.

Medication Management

3. Pillboxie

Platforms: iPhone, iPad

Cost: $0.99

Description: As caregivers, we are responsible for managing our clients' medications on a daily basis. Many of them are required to take a number of meds throughout the day at specific times. That's why we recommend using this app to help streamline the process. It allows you to set up reminders with visual pill boxes within the mobile application. Pillboxie is ideal for tech-savvy seniors or a family member acting as the primary caregiver for an aging loved one to ensure that no dose is missed or late. This app does not require a data connection and even sends reminders when your phone is asleep.

4. MedCoach

Platforms: Android, iPhone, iPad

Cost: Free

Description: Our caregivers love this app for many reasons: It has quick access to lists of medications, pill reminders with easy setup and even access to the pharmacy’s website to fill prescriptions. And all of this can be done right in the palm of your hand on your phone, tablet or other device.

To Pass The Time

5. Crosswords Classic

Platforms: Android, iPhone, iPad

Cost: $9.99

6. Sudoku

Platforms: Android, iPhone, iPad

Cost: Free

Description: Another great option is Sudoku, the numbers version of the classic crossword. It's also available for download and can be played anywhere.

7. Lumosity

Platforms:  Android, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad

Cost: Free

Description: Another app that is great for passing the time and keeping the brain sharp. Used by over 60 million people worldwide, this app is designed to help train memory and attention.

In Case of Emergency

8. Red Panic Button

Platforms: Android, iPhone, iPad

Cost: $2.99 plus fees for some features

Description: This is another important tool we can provide to our friends and loved ones. There may be times when a primary caregiver needs to go to the grocery store, step outside to get the mail or run an errand. Anything can happen, so providing your loved ones access to immediate help during the time they are alone is important. This app allows you to input both your information as well as your loved one's should an emergency occur. In order to report an emergency or a need for assistance, seniors simply open the app and hit the red button in the middle of screen. While the app charges for some features, that's a small price to pay for safety.


13. Blood Pressure Monitor
Available For: iPhone and iPad; Free

Having an accurate read of your blood pressure is important, especially for older adults. Track your blood pressure and weight over time without having to call your doctor or comb through old records. The Blood Pressure Monitor app provides statistical information, periodic health reminders and allows you to export data so you can share it with your personal health-care provider. This tool is a great way for seniors to oversee their health regimen and stay in shape.
