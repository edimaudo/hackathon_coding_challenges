## Go Innovation Jam 2021

##The Challenge Statement
***
How might we help older adults stay in their homes longer while maintaining their independence in a safer, healthier, and more cost-effective way.


## Background
As we get older, life can become more challenging, from standing on our own, to getting around town, to staying in touch with family and friends. So, we’re calling on participants to use emerging technology to develop ideas that lead to long-term solutions for ageing in place.

The ageing process creates physical, mental and social challenges. The older we get; the more health issues crop up. Some are sudden and unexpected, some are chronic. We lose mobility. We retire and must adjust to a fixed income. We become more socially isolated. All the while, we have to maintain our bodies, minds, and homes while we age-in-place.  

With the right technology we can improve quality of life and that’s why we’re hosting this Innovation Jam. It’s an open call for solutions to common issues older adults face. 

### Key areas
- Stay independent: physical, mental, financial freedom
- Safes Spaces: Reduce environmental risk, support mobility
- Long term health: keep treatable issues in check, identify new risks early
- Social connections: sustain relationships between family and friends to maintain mental health
