## Today’s Challenge:
Reveal the online discourse about environmental news so A Greener Future can deliver a unique perspective about their industry to their industry.

Some questions to ask yourself:
“How will I score a trend higher than the others?”
“Can I create new insights on a daily, weekly, or monthly cadence?”

“What visuals or insights will get us featured in a newsletter or blog?”
“What content would trend in r/Environment?”
