## Statheletes BIG DATA CUP 2025

### Objective
Our goal for the 2025 Big Data Cup is to both identify and provide opportunity for burgeoning analysts in the hockey analytics field while also pushing forward hockey research in the broader sphere


### THREE RESEARCH AREAS
This year's Big Data Cup offers three exciting research areas to explore! Tracking data must be used in any project.
Please identify in the title which area you will be focusing on:

**Team Coordination**
How do teams work together? Reveal valuable insights into team strategy and execution. Examples include:

- Zone breakouts
- Forecheck
- Transition play
- Special teams configurations

**Skating Ability**
How can skating be evaluated aside from speed? Redefine how skating ability is viewed to offer teams a deeper understanding of player performance. Examples include:

- Skating agility and lateral movement
- Stamina over long shifts and throughout a game
- Movement profile when skating versus without the puck

**Player Movement**
How do players' on-puck and off-puck movements influence team dynamics and game outcomes? Develop a better understanding of player actions and their ripple effects on the ice. Examples include:

- Creating space for themselves and teammates while on the puck
- Defensive anticipation and positioning
- Offensive off-puck awareness and positioning
- Note: These examples are just starting points. Let your creativity shine!
