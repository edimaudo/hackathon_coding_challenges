## About App
The app analyzes red and white wine samples to provide insights into quality.


## About Data
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
You can find the dataset (here)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality].
