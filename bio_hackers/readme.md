## Biohackers 2024 Hackathon
This hackathon is designed for biotech enthusiasts, developers, and researchers who want to explore the fusion of biological sciences with advanced technology. Whether you’re into bioinformatics, genetic engineering, or health tech, this event will challenge you to solve real-world problems and pioneer solutions at the cutting edge of biotech.

The hackathon kicked off in September, and gates will close on 25th October, so you still have time to dive in and contribute to the next wave of bio-innovation. With mentorship from industry experts and access to advanced tools, you’ll have everything you need to turn your ideas into impactful projects.

### About App
The app analyzes red and white wine samples to provide insights into quality.


### About Data
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
You can find the dataset (here)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality].
