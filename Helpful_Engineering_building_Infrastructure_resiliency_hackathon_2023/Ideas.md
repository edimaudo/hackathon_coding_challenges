# Overview
Over the last four decades, the prevalence of billion-dollar disasters has increased by a factor of four. Single natural disasters such as Winter Storm Uri in Texas in 2021 can cost almost US$200 billion.

In North America, physical infrastructure resiliency has become a major issue, affecting almost all industries. In the past four decades, 273 natural disasters costing over a billion dollars of damage hit the United States alone. In recent years, cold snaps and winter storms have become increasingly common. Since 2013, the United States has seen over a billion dollars of insured losses come from winter storms alone. Winter storm damages also directly hamper medical and community services, ranging from nursing homes and dialysis centers to hospitals, and thus destroy homes and entire communities in their wake. These cold snaps and winter stormsâ€™ impact is most concentrated in the Great Plains area.

North American physical infrastructure resiliency is a significant issue in several industries from water and electricity distribution to telecommunication and transportation. Thus, disadvantaged populations are often disproportionately impacted by these disasters since they are already susceptible to issues in these areas; a winter storm-induced disruption often leaves such people completely without such necessities.

# Challenge

# PROJECT AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
Submissions may take the form of a 3-5 minute video and a link to a slide deck. All code and project files must be committed to Github.

### What are the Great Plains of the United States?
The definition of the Great Plains is debated. Typically, it refers to the territory from Montana to Minnesota and down to New Mexico and Texas. In this study, a 12-state area is used, including Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.

### Ideas
- Transportation for people in need
 - E.g. People who have an emergency, groceries
  - A app that people can log into and select the type of help they need
- Improving bridge inspection using using camera
 - 
- Ability to see if there is a power outage in an area for a utility provider
- Lack of data and good information for people in need

### Notes from Elaine
Bridge Monitoring
Per U.S. Department of Transportation, there are 600,000 highway bridges in the U.S.A.;  1 in 13 are rated as being in poor condition
Project Idea #1 - Affordable Cameras on Bridges to Monitor Cracks/Damage
- Currently, some highway bridges have tools that are used to measure cracks; could cameras be added to these tools to make them more efficient?
- Cost of cameras (and the power they require) has dropped over the years, likely making this more feasible now than it would have been 10 years ago
- Possible Challenge - Frame Rate of Camera  
	- One study had a camera set-up to measure structure movement, but because the frame-rate of the camera was relatively slow, there were concerns that movement/measurements were being missed
- Possible Challenge - Cost Combined with Amount of Cameras
	- A bridge would require multiple cameras in order to be accurately monitored, which would increase the price

Project Idea #2 - Technical Solution to Make Using Sensors on Bridges (to Measure Temperature Changes) More Efficient
This is important because drastic temperature changes (like those that may occur in a blizzard) negatively impact the structure of a bridge
Current situation includes
Being able to accurately measure the temperature on all sides of a bridge (north facing side will often differ from south facing side)
Temperature sensors may not be able to be drilled into bridge (one bridge had to use adhesive sensors) and this resulted in less accurate measurements
Possible Challenge - Figuring out a solution that is scalable and more nuanced than simply getting more expensive sensors

Prompt
How can digital twins be used in microgrids?


Output
Digital twins can be used in microgrids to improve their design, operation, and maintenance. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical asset, such as a microgrid. It can be used to simulate the behavior of the microgrid in real-time, enabling operators to optimize its performance and make informed decisions.
Here are some ways digital twins can be used in microgrids:
Design optimization: Digital twins can be used to optimize the design of a microgrid before it is built. By simulating different configurations and operating scenarios, designers can identify the best combination of components and control strategies to achieve the desired performance.
Real-time monitoring and control: Once a microgrid is in operation, a digital twin can be used to monitor its performance in real-time. This enables operators to identify and diagnose issues quickly and make adjustments to optimize the microgrid's performance.
Predictive maintenance: Digital twins can be used to predict when maintenance is required on the components of a microgrid. By monitoring the performance of the components in real-time, the digital twin can identify when they are likely to fail, allowing maintenance to be scheduled before a failure occurs.
Testing and validation: Digital twins can be used to test and validate new control strategies and technologies before they are implemented in a real microgrid. This reduces the risk of failures and improves the overall performance of the microgrid.
Overall, digital twins can help improve the efficiency, reliability, and performance of microgrids, making them an important tool for the development and operation of distributed energy systems.

Hello, 

I would like to walk you through our project for the 2023 Helpful Engineering Hackathon.

My name is Edima and my team-mate is Elaine.

Let start with the overview
The caribbean region is grappling with a number of challenges
- Effects of Covid-19 on the economy 
  Negatively impact the tourism market
- Impacts of more frequent and adverse weather conditions (Dorian 2019 in the Bahamas)
  - Caused wide spread damage
- Ineffective grid infrastructure 
Very low electrification rates in places like rural Haiti

Key area we are focusing on 
Focusing on grid infrastructure as it is highly impacted by climate change

The objective of the challenge is 
How caribbean islands can build resilient grid infrastructure and what other approach can improve it 

Analysis
Countries like the Bahamas are moving to microgrids to decentralize their power supply and make them less vulnerable to hurricanes. 

Solution
Incorporating microgrids with digital twins allows for better economical analysis of the grid, operations management, grid configuration simulation and predicting maintenance needs.

Recommendations
Deploying micro-grids
Ensuring stakeholder collaboration
Leveraging digital twins

Benefits
The key benefits of deploying this solution are
cost savings
increased grid efficiency
Reduced downtime

Next steps
Shows a tenative timeline for deploying a micro grid built with digital twins
