FreshServe Lid. Fights Urban Food Deserts with Accessible Meal Kits
FreshServe Ltd. has been on a mission to provide meal kits to low-income areas lacking access to fresh produce. Founder and CEO Ahmed Malik started the company after witnessing the effects of food deserts in his own neighborhood. While FreshServe's delivery model has proved successful, recent challenges have surfaced, including a spike in ingredient costs and supply chain bottlenecks, which have forced the company to increase its meal kit prices slightly. However, FreshServe continues to expand its reach and establish local partnerships to address the high demand for affordable, fresh meal kits.

**Resource 5** - Internal Employee Commentary (Anonymous)
"Honestly, morale here at FreshServe is slipping. A lot of us feel like we’re just being pushed to hit numbers without any real recognition or support. The management team talks about our mission to fight food deserts, but inside the company it feels like that mission stops at the marketing materials. There’s little effort to motivate staff beyond constant reminders about deadlines and cost targets. Raises are rare, and most of us don’t see a path to grow in the company. It’s frustrating because many of us joined because we believed in what FreshServe stands for."

"Our managers seem to have adopted this top-down, almost authoritarian leadership style lately. There’s no room for new ideas—just follow orders, meet quotas, and don’t ask questions. And don’t get me started on their so-called 'lean production.' It just feels like code for cutting corners and squeezing more out of fewer people. We’re short-staffed in the kitchens, and yet we’re told to keep up the same output without any real process improvements or extra resources. The pressure is constant, and it’s burning people out."
