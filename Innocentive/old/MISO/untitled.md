## Features
Forced events to minor derates are supported and their detailed information is shared with market operators and regulatory authorities before outages occur and after-the-fact. PCI’s system also tracks the status of requests during different outage phases and allows for quick review and approval.  Further, analytics are included every step of the way for all events. On the transmission side, PCI provides a comprehensive tool kit to manage all grid outages while meeting all NERC requirements. 

Journal Module
Log and track any asset issues. Record chronologies of daily business events, perform regulatory compliance, and track internal workflows.

Scheduling Module
Automate the scheduling process so users can import, review and modify schedule data using PCI’s system or other applications (if desired). Users can verify schedule consistency with outages or derates.

Plant Instructions Module
Enhance communications between dispatchers and field personnel by providing an audited messaging system to support real-time three-way communications.

Plant Interface Module
Plant personnel can review and update operational data driving day-ahead and real-time market offers. They can then monitor and report on market-clearing results and prices in the DA/RT modes.

GADS Module
Better manage NERC GADS compliant outages, derates and reserve shutdown events while making those events available to other PCI or third-party applications.

includes tools and methodologies to extract and process bulk import or incremental updates from external, legacy third-party systems and databases. We have nearly 30 years of experience migrating geospatial data from these types of databases.

To support customers deploying a Digpro GIS platform that will serve as the new master for geospatial and/or network data, and who already operate third-party or legacy OMS/DMS systems, we can set up either incremental or transactional updates between the systems.

Customers with existing and/or legacy systems can retain the value of that data by transferring it to Digpro applications. Where necessary, we can provide the needed technical support and services to migrate, transform, or shape existing geospatial data for use in your new systems. 

Those services include:

Support for many GIS data formats
Bulk and/or incremental data migration
Geographic and schematic views
Identify and update deltas
Synchronize attributes
Geo references
Consolidate, aggregate, convert, or transform data
Assure migrated data quality

As industrial and utility organizations increasingly rely on the web to connect their data sources, security is a top concern. Smart devices and sensors, connected via the Internet of Things, continue to expand the attack surface for potential intruders.

Defending your organization against cyber threats is a top priority for Digpro. We ensure the highest possible levels of security for our software products, systems, and services through an in-depth, multi-layer protection strategy. Some of the security measures in place include:

Documented initiatives, based on and/or aligned with accepted industry standards and practices, to build security into every step of our software development process, including design, implementation, verification, release, and training
On-going activities related to improving software security, including robustness testing, vulnerability scanning, and security testing that encompasses static code and/or binary code analysis
Industry-standard cryptographic tools and security functionality, including:
– Cryptographic algorithms to hash, encrypt, or sign data for storage or transmission.
– Protocols and procedures to support cryptographic algorithms (e.g., to exchange certificates, establish keys, or generate random numbers)
− Functionality to authenticate end users or for access control
Proactively prevent malware propagation, primarily via scans of software deliverables and their storage/delivery media, using the most-current, appropriate antivirus tools
Properly handling and protecting all digital certificates used in software development to sign code or as a root to derive product-specific certificates
The Digpro software platform is highly secure, with data integrity and consistency guaranteed by constraints in the database and the authorization system. All users have unique security credentials, with updates done through “change sets” that allow for long transactions. All updates are verified to ensure compliance with the rules before they are executed. For example, it is impossible to post a cable “In Service” unless the connectivity component exists and shows where the cable is fed from. The authorization system is based on user privileges at a table and column level.

All Digpro applications and software products provide capabilities to integrate third-party security solutions such as firewalls, antivirus, network/host intrusion detection, and security monitoring. Digpro recommends that you leverage our partner network to secure your IT and automation systems with industry-standard malware and intrusion-protection solutions that include anti-virus protection and application whitelisting.

## Tech Setup
platform is a web-based, open system built on industry-standard technology.
base platform includes a unique, purpose-built GIS platform
 integrate the latest innovations in database technology. The advanced, distributed, web-based architecture, built-in GIS engine, and workflow management provide a highly effective tool to manage the big data of utilities of all sizes. All network objects are connected with respect to pre-built physical and logical design rules. Modules and components work together to create a robust, scalable, high-performance system.


Open standards
The Digpro platform is a web-based, open system built on industry-standard technology. Data models comply with OpenGIS specifications for spatial data, and follow relevant IEC specifications for network model data. The system is platform-independent and able to run on virtually any operating system, but is commonly run on both Windows and Linux systems.


Web solution
The web clients require only a standard web browser such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer supporting HTML5 on any mobile device. The Digpro main user-interface client runs on operating system that supports Java


Scalability
One of the strengths of the Digpro platform lies in its scalability. Thanks to the three-tier architecture design, the middle-logic tier is implemented on a cluster of web servers. All big-data processing is done in the database, resulting in optimal performance. No matter if a customer has only a few users or several thousands, all can simultaneously access the system. If additional user capacity is needed, the system can be effortlessly expanded by adding web servers and growing the database.


Interoperability
Organizations often need to integrate services and data from many different sources and in different formats. They also want to support a wide range of business processes across their organizations. Digpro is committed to the open standards and interoperability that enable this type of environment.
