## ABOUT THE SEEKER
The A2A Group is the largest Italian multi utility, at the forefront of territorial services and technological solutions. We design smart and sustainable cities, with respect for the citizens, we are protagonists of energy transition, and we implement the principle of the circular economy in all of our activities. With a far-reaching strategic plan, we manage the generation, sale and distribution of electricity and gas, district heating, waste collection and recovery, e-mobility, public lighting, and the integrated water services.

## ABSTRACT
Agrophotovoltaic is making inroads in Italy following the investment in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) of the Next Generation EU funds, which allocates around 2% of agricultural land to the installation of photovoltaic systems. The aim of the measure is to combine solar panels and food crops on the same unit of land in order to maximize the use of land and RES share while maintaining its fertility. A2A therefore aims to identify the best crops in Italy that can be coupled with PV systems without being impacted or benefiting from the presence of PV system. Agrophotovoltaic structures can differ from standard ground-mounted PV ones, in fact they can be designed taller, movable, semitransparent, … to maximize the crops growth, hence taking into account various factors such as their diffusion in the agricultural business, cultivation techniques and the performance of the crop.

## Overview
Agrophotovoltaic is today an increasingly emerging business in Italy, especially following the huge investments of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) that in 2021 has allocated about 1.1 billion euro for its development. The objective of the investment in agrophotovoltaic is to install, when fully operational, a production capacity from agrophotovoltaic plants of 1.04 GW, with an average annual production of about 1,300 GWh per year and a consequent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 0.8 million tons of CO2, without the compromise of land dedicated to agriculture.

To succeed in doing this, it is necessary to identify the crops which can best adapt to the presence of photovoltaic panels, and even taking advantage of them thanks to the presence of PV system. A2A therefore aims to identify the best crops that can grow together with future agrophotovoltaic plants which will be designed with the objective of maximizing the cultivation of crops, hence taking into account various factors such as their diffusion in the agricultural business, cultivation techniques and the performance of the crop.

## BACKGROUND
The increased demand for solar generation to achieve the Net Zero Emissions scenario by 2050, which requires about 24% annual average increase over the 2020-2030 period, has brought agrophotovoltaic (APV) to become one of the possible trends of greatest interest in Italy.

Italy is indeed a country with a very large total agricultural area (16.7 mln hectares) and an equally significant utilized agricultural area (13 mln hectares), which means that, according to ISTAT 2018 data, 1.5 mln economic units have developed in the agricultural sector, of different extents. However, the farming lands present a very different orographic conformation (41.6% hilly, 35.2% mountainous and 23.2% flat), resulting in a diversification of the cultivated crop, both by criteria of feasibility and landscape permits.

Italian crops indeed range, with different territorial extensions, from cereals (wheat, corn, rice, ...) to vegetables, legumes, tubers and fruit (so tomatoes, industrial or greenhouse, potatoes, citrus fruits, ...), each of which has different methods of cultivation and irrigation, and different machinery used for the purpose.

For this wide variety of factors to be considered, the agrophotovoltaic is a business that requires a thorough study of the agricultural needs of crops and the farmers to be properly developed and, obviously, to design the  photovoltaic structures and control systems that best suit the machinery and methods of cultivation of the same.

A2A, therefore, aims to identify the best crops to grow in correspondence with future agrophotovoltaic plants, taking into account various factors such as their diffusion in the agricultural business, cultivation techniques and the performance of the crop.

## THE CHALLENGE

A2A is looking for innovative solutions and/or whitepapers for the identification of optimal crops for agrophotovoltaic application and main cultivation needs that have to be considered in agrophotovoltaic system design and operation, with a special interest in the ones most widespread in the Italian market and most suitable for the Italian geography and climate conditions.

Any proposed solution should address the following Solution Requirements: 

### Must have:

1) **Crop diffusion in the agriculture business**: any solution or academic research must refer to crops that are currently cultivated or economically interesting in the Italian market, and that foresee large agricultural cultivation in PV systems with a lifetime of more than 25 years. All crops, even with ideal performance in partial shade that have no or limited market, should be excluded.
2) **Crop monoculture or rotation**: selected crops must be suitable for monoculture or crop rotation. In the second case the different crops have to be selected among the ones that share the same physiognomy (crop height and row spacing) and machinery, to be compatible with the tailored PV structure.
3) **Good performance in partial shadow**: the identified crop must be able to grow in or even benefit from the partial shadow from solar modules (i.e. -40% compared to the no-PV base case) and to tolerate a great range of radiation loss (i.e. -20% to -60%). Indeed, these crops are going to be harvested in plants that are likely to be of the single-axis tracker type (rows of modules aligned N-S and rotating E-W) whose radiation variation depends on the spacing of the rows of modules, the width of the rows of modules, the height of the center of rotation along the E-W axis.
4) **Irrigation mode indication**: the irrigation mode required by the identified crops must be compatible with or even benefit from the presence of photovoltaic modules.
5) **Resilience to extreme weather events (hail, drought, ...)**: if the identified crop can be damaged by weather events and protecting structures could be installed to protect them, such structures could be integrated or saved thanks to the presence of agrophotovoltaic system. An indication of any external structures that prevent these phenomena is to be specified. Crops that can benefit from the protective function of PV modules are preferred.
6) **Agriculture machinery compatibility**: the identified crops must be harvested with machinery compatible with the presence of PV modules/structures in the field. Preference should be given to crops that require machinery with a low factor of increase in the capex of the PV system (calculated considering the type, width, radius of curvature and height of the machinery). Moreover, an indication of the necessity of temporary or permanent external structures to improve crop yield and quality (properties) and/or to reduce damage risk has to be specified, such as nets for protection during planting, or for hail. Crops harvest considering suitable external structures can be taken into consideration.

The Seeker reserves the right to award only the solution which receive the highest score considering the following metrics:
- Market presence and share [cultivated acres; % of cultivated land]
- Geographical diffusion [% in different zones: North, Centre, South, Islands]
- Need of crop yearly rotation or seasonal alternation [Yes/No]
- Maximum expected impact of shading and shading range [% of crop yield decrease]
- Minimum size of machinery for proposed monoculture or crop rotation [width, curvature radius and heigh]
- Irrigation type and frequency in different seasons [type/season]
- Need of/benefit from external structures [Yes/No]
- If necessary/useful, interchangeability of external structures with agrophotovoltaic ones [Yes/No]
- If necessary/useful, type [Fixed/Removable]
- If necessary/useful, cost of alternative structures to improve crop yield and quality and/or to reduce demage risk [€/acre]
- If necessary/useful, expected impact on crop yield [% of crop yield increase ; €/acre]
- If necessary/useful, expected impact on crop quality [% of crop quality increase ; €/acre]
