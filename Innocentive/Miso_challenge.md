# Challenge

## ABSTRACT
MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) is an independent, not-for-profit, member-based organization that delivers safe, cost-effective electric power across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. A major service they provide is the coordination of scheduled and unscheduled outages of electricity generation and transmission assets. These assets are controlled by various stakeholders and must occasionally be taken offline for maintenance and repair. MISO must ensure that these outages don’t jeopardize the stability and functionality of the bulk electric system while still allowing for the necessary downtime. Currently, MISO has a complex and time consuming process for scheduling outages and they are seeking a better method. Rather than simply automating the current process they are using this Challenge to gather new and different approaches to outage coordination.

## ABOUT
Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. (MISO) is an independent, not-for-profit organization that delivers safe, cost-effective electric power to 42 million end-use customers across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. MISO is committed to reliability, nondiscriminatory operation of the bulk power transmission system and collaborating with all stakeholders to create cost-effective and innovative solutions for a changing industry. MISO operates one of the world's largest energy markets with more than $22 billion in annual gross market energy transactions. In 2019, the efforts of MISO and its members provided between $3.1 to $3.9 billion in regional benefits, driven by enhanced reliability, more efficient use of the region’s transmission and generation assets, and a reduced need for new assets.
MISO's world-class energy markets serve as a platform for matching the supply and demand of energy. As a result, our energy markets and their efficient operation optimize transmission utilization, allow market transparency, eliminate pancaked transmission rates and centralize unit commitment and dispatch.

## OVERVIEW
Every large organization deals with resource scheduling and allocation. Whether it involves equipment, raw materials, supplies, or human resources, planning for scheduled and unscheduled shortages or outages is an essential component of running an efficient and responsive organization. Take, for example, a city with a surrounding network of roads and highways as well as parking garages in the city. The roadways and garages need periodic maintenance and repair and we would hope the city has a system to easily and efficiently evaluate the timing of road construction and parking garage repair to ensure there is adequate road capacity and parking availability during these outages. Similarly, if a bridge collapses or emergency pothole repair is required the system should adapt quickly to assess and possibly postpone scheduled outages to ensure traffic continues to flow.
This city example involves one stakeholder controlling the assets for which outages are to be scheduled and thus the scheduling should be straightforward. Imagine a scenario where multiple stakeholders control the assets and the organization responsible for scheduling has little to no visibility into the stakeholders’ individual resource schedules. This is a vastly simplified view of the situation MISO faces. As the operator of a significant portion of the bulk electric system in the U.S. and parts of Canada they are responsible for managing planned and unplanned outages across their network. The outage coordination service MISO supplies to its participants relies on multiple tools to analyze and account for expected future supply and demand of electricity, weather, and regional conditions to ensure that assets can be taken offline without impacting the reliability of the bulk electric system. The analysis tools are not integrated with the scheduling or forecasting systems and this leads to a complex and time consuming process for scheduling outages. The focus of this Challenge is not on suggestions for automating the current system, but rather on new and different approaches for outage coordination that is efficient, transparent, and allows for a high level of self-service capability for the participants.

## BACKGROUND
MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) is an independent, not-for-profit, member-based organization that delivers safe, cost-effective electric power across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. A major service they provide is the coordination of scheduled and unscheduled outages of electricity generation and transmission assets. These assets are controlled by various stakeholders and must occasionally be taken offline for maintenance and repair. MISO must ensure that these outages don’t jeopardize the stability and functionality of the bulk electric system while still allowing for the necessary downtime.
MISO has a complex and time-consuming process for scheduling outages. The tools used to analyze outage requests are not integrated with the scheduling system or the forecasting system.  As requests are received, they are processed for analysis along with the most current forecast available and stored in a decentralized manner from the schedule of approved outages. As better information becomes available, such as firm outage dates, updated forecasts, availability of other resources on the system, etc., updated analysis must be run. There are many challenges and inefficiencies in the current process. The outage request tool is not connected to the analysis tools so data must be manually transferred between the two. There is no automatic validation for completeness or accuracy of the data entered for an outage request. Any change to the analysis (most commonly weather, availability of other resources, and forecasted load of the grid) require a complete restudy of the outage in question. These challenges result in delays in approving requested outages and even simple requests may take days to approve since all requests must undergo the same approval process.

## THE CHALLENGE
MISO envisions a future where resource maintenance and outage scheduling is handled in a more automated, self-service environment. In this future, the entire needs of asset maintenance are captured and optimized. The future capabilities of MISO’s operations need to reduce human dependencies and still operate with the highest reliability and efficiency possible.
Specifically, MISO seeks to improve in the following areas:

- How does MISO increase the certainty around outages?
- How do we minimize dependence on MISO staff?
- What technologies would lead to greater predictability and accuracy? How could we implement those?
- What mathematical models or algorithms could be applied to MISO’s outage coordination process?
- What would simplify the process?

Any proposed solution should address the following Solution Requirements: 

Propose a new approach to outage coordination that focuses on one or more of the following components:
- Allows resource down time while protecting system integrity by ensuring a minimum quality of available resources
- Balances overall system integrity with fairness to individual resource owners in allowing for routine maintenance
- Integrates the request, analysis, and scheduling functions while allowing visibility of availability to requestors.
- Provide detailed and specific guidance on how to implement major components of the proposed solution and how each component interacts with the other components, including stakeholder systems and input.
The solutions would preferably satisfy the additional following criteria (but not essential):
- Provides insight into how other industries handle scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in high reliability environments.

## Project Criteria

Submitted proposals along with all relevant supporting data should include the information described in the Detailed Description of the Challenge.
