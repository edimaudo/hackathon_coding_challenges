# Eliminating Deep Seepage from a Tailings Storage Facility

## OVERVIEW

United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel), the Seeker for this Innocentive Challenge, is seeking novel, passive approaches that eliminate or significantly reduce deep seepage from the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) at the U.S. Steel Minntac facility.

Minntac is a legacy facility where iron-bearing rock called taconite is mined, extracted, and processed into iron ore pellets which are then used in steelmaking. Tailings produced from ore processing are deposited in the TSF. Sulfates and other constituents generated through this process are retained within a closed-loop water system at the site, held in a tailings basin and managed at the TSF. However, water from the basin is currently leaving the containment infrastructure and potentially seeping into regional groundwater.

Solutions must address deep seepage that can potentially daylight (restore from underground) to surface waters. Future environmental regulations will likely classify current deep seepage as functionally equivalent to surface water discharge (with new limits on parameters such as sulfate, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, etc.).

This Prize Challenge invites innovators, research teams, and leading organizations to propose new strategies, techniques, or systems that eliminate or significantly reduce deep seepage from the TSF at the U. S. Steel Minntac facility in Mountain Iron, Minnesota. Solvers are invited to propose novel materials, in-situ treatments, geotechnical barriers, or multi-system approaches that avoid high capital costs or long construction timelines.

A winning submission will demonstrate a clear path towards a passive, cost-effective, and permanent solution, and will be evaluated against its practical feasibility.

## Background

At U.S. Steel Minntac, process waters containing sulfate, TDS, conductivity and other pollutants originates from the oxidation of sulfide-bearing minerals during taconite ore processing. The process waters are retained within a closed-loop water system, held inside the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) or tailings basin at the north side of the plant. The tailings basin contains approximately 13 billion gallons of process water, and spans roughly 8,000 acres.

Figure: an aerial view of the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) at U.S. Steel Minntac, located in Northern Minnesota close to the city of Virginia, MN. The yellow border indicates the borders of the TSF. The water at the North and North East sides of the TSF are the tailings basin.

While surface seepage (approximately 0 to 12 feet deep) from the basin is managed via an east and west return system, the deeper seepage water into the surrounding area remains largely uncontrolled – with water potentially seeping through fractured rocks around and beneath the edges of the basin. Towards the surface, process water is still passing through coarse (like sand and gravel) and fine (e.g. siltier material) tailing barriers or dams into the native soil, eventually potentially reaching the regional groundwater. There is no engineered liner beneath the TSF and, at deeper points, the basin floor is very close to bedrock which is enabling underground seepage.

Deep seepage from the basin discharges eastward to the Sand River and westward to the Dark River. Upcoming regulations may classify these seepage flows as being functionally equivalent to surface discharges – meaning sulfate limits (as well as other limits) will be triggered at compliance points, including groundwater monitoring wells and surrounding surface waters.

A current mitigation focus has included a proposed cutoff wall to line the north eastern perimeter of the basin, 3 miles long and 3 feet thick. This would run from the surface all the way down to the floor and notched into the bedrock layer. The cutoff wall depth could reach ~150 feet, but with an average of about 50 feet deep into the basin. This feat of engineering would likely have large cost and timeline implications, as well as not addressing issues on the west side of the basin.

U. S. Steel is therefore open to alternative approaches that offer lower cost, reduced environmental disturbance, overall facility compliance or shorter construction timelines than the currently proposed cutoff wall. While solutions that can be implemented within 2–3 construction seasons are desirable, U. S. Steel will also consider longer-term approaches if they offer significant advantages in cost, performance, or sustainability.

## The Challenge

Solvers are asked to propose a passive solution that eliminates or significantly reduces deep seepage from the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) at U. S. Steel Minntac.

Solutions should address the geological complexity of the TSF site, preserve the integrity and function of the collection return system for surface water and existing earthen dams and dikes, and ideally provide a lower-cost, shorter timeline alternative to a full cutoff wall.

Concepts must be suitable for permanent compliance at the site, given that tailings containment and water quality compliance limits will be required indefinitely regardless if the mine is open or even still operated by U. S. Steel.

Key environmental considerations for any solution include:

The subsurface geology of the basin includes fractured bedrock, which contributes to both the scale of seepage, its unpredictable pathways, and the difficulty in initial mitigation
The TSF’s structure, while unlined, consists of various dams and dikes at the surface, and walls of fine tailings cores and coarse tailing barriers
The scale of the facility – the TSF covers 8,000 acres and the basin itself contains an estimated 13 billion gallons of water
Solvers are asked to concentrate their solutions on addressing deep seepage at the basin. Surface seepage at the facility is currently managed by a collection return system.

 

## SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

Innovation and creative thinking to meet the requirements are welcomed, providing solutions display a strong technical feasibility and evidence-based justification.

Solutions from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2-5 are preferred, spanning ideation-level ideas for what can be done to proof-of-concept solutions that use evidence-backed examples to demonstrate the feasibility of your approach.

Any successful solution to the Challenge will need to satisfy the following must have requirements:

1) **Eliminate or significantly reduce deep seepage of water from the TSF at the U.S. Steel Minntac facility to the surrounding groundwater**
- Solvers should propose functional, effective, and economically viable approaches
- Any approach or solution must not impact the function of the TSF’s collection return system for surface seepage or the stability of the basin’s dam and dikes infrastructure
- Additionally, U.S. Steel would be amenable to methods/solutions/approaches that achieve reduction of deep seepage while also addressing sulfate concentrations within the basin water or groundwater at compliance sample locations (such that the level does not exceed permit concentration levels)
2) **Prevent future environmental liabilities, secondary contamination/seepage pathways, or future legacy issues**
3) **Minimized capital and operating costs of solution** – U. S. Steel is looking for innovative approaches that can achieve the desired outcome while balancing operational and set-up costs. Please detail all costs in your submission and be communicative of potential timelines.
4) **Ability to operate in cold temperatures** – with lows of −60 °F or −51.1 °C recorded in Northern Minnesota winters in extreme cases - please state any area of your solution that may be negatively impacted by cold temperatures.

Additionally, U. S. Steel would be particularly interested in solutions that display the following nice-to-have criteria:

1) *Increased networked effectiveness of the facility - in addressing the elimination or reduction of deep seepage at Minntac, Solvers are encouraged to consider the wider operations of the plant and how to maintain, as far as possible, the ordinary operations involved in storage of tailings and process water. Solutions that also improve the collection return of surficial seepage will be well received.*
2) *Minimized ecological disturbance during implementation.*
 

**Things to Avoid/Out of Scope:**

Solutions that require full or partial basin dewatering are likely infeasible, and plans for complete basin lining have likely already been scoped and are covered by the plan for a potential cutoff wall, and should therefore be avoided.
 
Solutions with Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 2-5 are invited.
