## MISO Visibility Challenge: Using Predictive Analytics to Manage People Talent

### ABSTRACT

The post-COVID work environment has seen unprecedented shifts in employee preferences. They require more flexibility in the ways they do their work, and they also demand this work to be more intellectually stimulating. This poses additional challenges for MISO’s succession planning and allocation of employees brought on by retirements and employee turnover. MISO is therefore interested in finding new approaches to the areas of employee retention and talent acquisition.

In this Challenge, MISO is looking for methods and tools of predictive analytics to improve employee retention and talent acquisition. MISO is requesting a comprehensive review of the field of predictive analytics tools applied to human resources. MISO is also asking for specific suggestions on how these tools could be put into practice to achieve its goals.

### OVERVIEW

The post-COVID work environment has seen unprecedented shifts in employee preferences. They require more flexibility in the ways they do their work as hybrid work arrangements become common. Employees also demand their work to be more intellectually and emotionally stimulating. All this happens against the background of a higher-than-usual number of employees who leave or retire earlier than usual. This poses additional challenges for MISO’s succession planning, and MISO is interested in finding innovative, data-driven approaches to the areas of employee retention and talent acquisition.

In this Challenge, MISO is looking for methods and tools of predictive analytics to improve employee retention and talent acquisition. An “ideal” solution to this Challenge will consist of two parts. First, Solvers will compose a comprehensive review of the field of predictive analytics tools applied to business human resources. Second, Solvers will formulate specific suggestions on how identified tools could be put into practice to improve employee retention and talent acquisition.

## Detailed Description and Requirements

**BACKGROUND**

The U.S. electric grid undergoes a rapid evolution in the ways it loads, generates, transmits, and distributes power. Having conducted an in-depth analysis of these changes, MISO has identified three over-arching trends, referred to as the “3Ds”:  

De-Marginalization – refers to the modified set of resources that can provide the next needed, or “marginal,” increment of energy at zero additional costs (e.g., renewables), or very low additional costs (e.g., highly efficient gas-fired generation). 
Decentralization – the shift from large, centralized power plants to smaller, often distributed resources that are located on local networks, or “behind the meter” at homes and businesses. 
Digitalization – the continued disruption of the energy industry due to the recent advancements in information and communication technologies.
For more information on these trends, please see the 2019 MISO Forward report (https://www.misoenergy.org/forward/forward-2019/).

To face this new business environment, MISO has defined three key innovation areas:  

Availability – the ability to meet customer energy needs at all hours of operation.
Flexibility – the ability to anticipate and adapt to frequent, significant changes in energy output and demand.
Visibility – the ability to correctly predict the need for relevant resources for current operations and the foreseeable future.
For more information on these innovation areas, please see the 2020 MISO Forward report (http://view.misoenergy.org/misoforward2020/p/1)

The MISO Visibility Challenge is looking for a comprehensive review of methods and tools of predictive analytics to improve employee retention and talent acquisition.

**CURRENT TECHNOLOGY**

The post-COVID work environment has seen unprecedented shifts in employee preferences. More and more often, employees want more flexibility in the ways they do their jobs; remote and hybrid work arrangements are becoming common. Employees also pay more attention to the work itself, demanding it to be more intellectually and emotionally stimulating. All this happens against the background of what many call The Great Resignation, the higher-than-usual number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs from late 2020 to early 2021.

Adding to the “normal” load of retirements and employee turnover, these factors present an additional challenge to MISO’s staffing needs. Consequently, we’re looking for new, innovative approaches to anticipating these changes, especially in two specific areas: employee retention and talent recruitment.

We believe that the application of predictive analytics tools may well become such an approach. The objective of the MISO Visibility Challenge is, therefore, to identify methods and tools of predictive analytics to improve MISO’s employee retention and talent recruitment. We’re interested in a comprehensive review of the field and in specific recommendations on how identified tools could be put into practice in our day-to-day operations.

## Solution Requirements
To provide a solution to this Challenge, the following questions need to be answered: 

- What specific predictive analytics methods and tools have been applied to the areas of employee retention and talent recruitment?
- Are any of these methods and tools commercially available?
- What specific factors and information, both qualitative and quantitative, need to be considered?
- Which datasets need to be built to feed into specific algorithms?
- Are there examples of organizations that have successfully used predictive analytics to improve employee retention and talent recruitment?

We’re also looking for answers to questions related specifically to employee retention:
- Are there ways for MISO to predict near, -mid-, and long-term rates of employee attrition and retention?
- Can we predict that a specific employee will leave? Which data features are most important and relevant in making this prediction?
- How can we apply employee data to help them find better positions elsewhere within MISO?

In the area of talent recruitment, we’d like to know the answers to the following questions:
- How can MISO use data analytics to predict future needs in position and staffing?
- How do we match new talent with our business needs facing constantly changing industry terminology?
- Are there changes in the ways colleges and universities in North America address the evolving nature of the energy industry?

An “ideal” solution to this Challenge will consist of two parts. 
First, the Solvers should provide a comprehensive literature review of the application of predictive analytics to the field of talent management, more specifically, to employee retention and talent recruitment. This review should list all important contributions to the topic in the form of research articles, reviews, online portals, algorithms, etc. All mentioned items must be properly referenced or linked. The Solvers are also expected to provide at least a brief comment to every entry, for example, a short summary of a published article.

Second, based on the provided review, the Solvers should present a set of recommendations on how MISO should use identified tools to improve employee retention and talent acquisition. Which specific tools show the most promise given MISO’s objectives? In which precise orders should these tools be used? What are the approximate timeframe and budget requirements for their implementation?

## THINGS TO AVOID
To repeat, the objective of this Challenge is to **provide MISO with working tools and an actionable plan to use predictive analytics to improve employee retention and talent recruitment**. We’re, therefore, not interested in a simple list of references to available resources. Every entry to the tool list must be justified and explained.

Naturally, we will not accept solutions that point to unethical, much less illegal, tools and approaches.

## Output
Any proposed solution should address the following Solution Requirements: 

- The proposed solution should present a comprehensive review of the field of application of methods and tools of predictive analytics to the process of employee retention and talent recruitment.
- The proposed solution should also present a set of specific recommendations that MISO could use to apply the identified methods and tools to its day-to-day talent management activities.
- All proposed recommendations should be practical enough in terms of the time and effort needed for their implementation. “Try this, it may work” solutions will not be accepted.
- The proposed solution should offer the Seeker client “freedom to practice” or be available for potential licensing. There should be no third-party patent art preventing the use of specific equipment and materials for their commercial application.
- Although we’re interested in both areas of employee retention and talent recruitment, we will also consider submissions providing exceptionally strong coverage of only one area, either employee retention or talent recruitment.


## Project Criteria
- Submitted proposals must be written in English and should include the information described in the Detailed Description of the Challenge along with all relevant supporting data.
- The Seeker may wish to partner with the Solver at the conclusion of the Challenge. Solvers are welcome to describe their expertise and include a statement indicating their interest in this opportunity.
