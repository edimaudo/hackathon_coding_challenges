## THE CHALLENGE
MISO envisions a future where resource maintenance and outage scheduling is handled in a more automated, self-service environment. In this future, the entire needs of asset maintenance are captured and optimized. The future capabilities of MISO’s operations need to reduce human dependencies and still operate with the highest reliability and efficiency possible.
Specifically, MISO seeks to improve in the following areas:

- How does MISO increase the certainty around outages?
- How do we minimize dependence on MISO staff?
- What technologies would lead to greater predictability and accuracy? How could we implement those?
- What mathematical models or algorithms could be applied to MISO’s outage coordination process?
- What would simplify the process?

Any proposed solution should address the following Solution Requirements: 

Propose a new approach to outage coordination that focuses on one or more of the following components:
- Allows resource down time while protecting system integrity by ensuring a minimum quality of available resources
- Balances overall system integrity with fairness to individual resource owners in allowing for routine maintenance
- Integrates the request, analysis, and scheduling functions while allowing visibility of availability to requestors.
- Provide detailed and specific guidance on how to implement major components of the proposed solution and how each component interacts with the other components, including stakeholder systems and input.
The solutions would preferably satisfy the additional following criteria (but not essential):
- Provides insight into how other industries handle scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in high reliability environments.

## Project Criteria
Submitted proposals along with all relevant supporting data should include the information described in the Detailed Description of the Challenge. The solution may combine existing components, commercially available components, and/or novel Solver solutions. Ideas leveraged from other industries with similar problems are encouraged.

The submitted proposal must be written in English and should include the following:
1) An Abstract and optional Conclusion.
2) Detailed description of an approach to an outage coordination system that can meet the above Solution Requirements. This must include:
a) A detailed block diagram/wireframe view of the proposed system with major components and information flow indicated
b) Specific details of each component and how to implement the functionality of the component. This may include custom or commercial software, and in the case of custom software a detailed description of the algorithm and architecture is required
c) Detailed narratives for different outage request scenarios beginning with a request from a participant. Narratives must describe the information flow between components, the decision process within relevant components, and the operation of each component utilized in the scenario. Scenarios must include:
- A simple outage request that can be approved automatically
- An outage request that requires a full outage study and is approved
- An outage request that is denied
3) Rationale as to why the Solver believes that the proposed system will work. This rationale should address each of the Solution Requirements described in the Detailed Description and should be supported with any relevant examples and/or scenarios.
4) Data, drawings etc. necessary to convey the full extent of the proposed solution.
