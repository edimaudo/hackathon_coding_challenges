# Improving efficiency of low molecular weight radioligands for cancer therapy


## OVERVIEW

Debiopharm, the Seeker for this Innocentive Challenge, is looking for novel broadly applicable approaches to reducing the renal reabsorption of low-molecular weight radioligands, in particular small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, as a means of improving the efficiency and safety of these types of compounds in cancer therapy.

In recent years, low-molecular weight radioligands, e.g. small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, have emerged as a promising approach to treat cancers that are characterized by overexpression of specific surface targets. Prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumors are typical examples of this type of cancer.

However, such compounds face a major physiological hurdle: renal reabsorption. Due to their small size these radioligands are freely filtered through renal glomeruli and can be actively reabsorbed in renal cells, resulting in renal radiotoxicity and renal impairment, or even renal failure.

Current approaches to reducing the renal absorption of low-molecular weight radioligands, e.g. small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, are insufficient; novel broadly applicable approaches are therefore needed.

## Background

In recent years, low-molecular weight radioligands, e.g., small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, have emerged as a promising approach to treat cancers that are characterized by overexpression of specific surface targets. Prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumors are typical examples of this type of cancer.

Low-molecular weight radioligands are composed of a small targeting ligand linked to a therapeutic radioisotope. This ligand specifically targets and binds to transmembrane receptors or antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. Following this binding, the radioisotope emits ionizing radiation (either alpha or beta particles) that kills the cancer cells.

Low-molecular weight radioligands generally consist of three parts:

1) The low-molecular weight targeting agent e.g., small peptide or small-peptidomimetic. An agent characterized by low molecular weight (<5 kDa), the ability to rapidly penetrate tumors, and fast clearance from the blood.
2) The radioisotope. Two specific radioactive isotopes are commonly used in low-molecular weight radioligands: beta-emitter Lutetium-177 (177Lu) and alpha-emitter Actinium-225 (225Ac). Both are characterized by the high energy and very short range of the emitted particles.
3) The linker. The radioactive isotope is generally sequestered by a chelating agent (e.g., DOTA) that is connected to the low-molecular weight targeting ligand via some sort of linker, e.g., an alkyl chain, PEG, or a peptide-based linker.
Even though low-molecular weight radioligands, in particular small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, show a lot of promise in terms of efficient tumor targeting, they still face a major hurdle: renal reabsorption. Due to their size, these radioligands are freely filtered through renal glomeruli and can be actively reabsorbed by renal cells.

Renal reabsorption varies but can exceed 90% of the filtered load. Such renal reabsorption can not only reduce drug availability for tumors, lowering the therapeutic index of a treatment, but can also result in renal radiotoxicity and renal impairment, or even renal failure. Overall, renal reabsorption poses significant constraints over low-molecular weight radioligand dosing in clinical setting, reducing patient outcomes.

Several broadly applicable approaches are known to reduce renal reabsorption of low-molecular weight radioligands – such as small-peptide radioligands and small-peptidomimetic radioligands – including:

- Co-administration of basic amino acids, Gelofusine (succinylated gelatin), or albumin-binding moieties.
- Conjugation of radioligands to albumin binding moieties.
- Incorporation of hydrophilic linkers.
- Removal of charged residues from small-peptide sequences.


## SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

By posting this Challenge, we’re looking for novel broadly applicable approaches to reducing the renal reabsorption of low-molecular weight radioligands, particularly small-peptide radioligands or small-peptidomimetic radioligands, as a means of improving their efficacy for cancer therapy.

We explicitly welcome proposals that define transferable design rules or modular strategies expected to be applicable to a wide range of low-molecular weight radioligands, independent of tumor indication, molecular target, or radioisotope. While not required, submissions that also provide a concrete example of how the strategy could be applied to create an actual product will be particularly valued.

We envision that this can be achieved by following several directions:

- Chemical and molecular design approaches, such as systematic modulation of linker architecture, physicochemical properties, or amino-acid composition of small-peptide or peptidomimetic targeting agents,
- Generalizable target-interaction or receptor-engagement strategies, for example multivalent, bispecific, or alternative binding paradigms that can be applied across different targets without compromising tumor affinity.
- Platform-type formulation or conjugation strategies, including modular or reversible conjugation concepts that can be broadly implemented without dependence on a specific radioligand or radioisotope.
