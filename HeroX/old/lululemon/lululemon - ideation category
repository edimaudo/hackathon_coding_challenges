Challenge Information

Let your Imagination Soar
You may have an idea of what lululemon stores look like today, how it feels to be inside of them, the goal of your visit, and how much time you spend there. What would be possible if we removed those constraints?
What if you visited the space just once for 2 hours? 6 hours? Overnight? How might you improve the wellbeing of an individual?
What if you visited the space on a regular basis? How might you improve the wellbeing of an individual in this instance?
What if the space was not confined by the four walls? What if the space was configurable?
What new technology could be incorporated into these physical locations that would meaningfully improve the health of an individual and/or a community in a single visit?
What if there was only one person in the store? What if there were 300 people?
What if the stores were not primarily transactional and didn’t even need to make money?

============
Challenge Structure

Propose a solution that can be applied to the store environment
Propose a solution that is based on current scientific understanding

==================
Business Background
==================
At lululemon, we believe in the three pillars of wellbeing that we call the Sweatlife: the mind, the body, and the community around us. 
For the body, we believe regular physical activity and simple whole food nutrition are the foundation. 
For the mind, we believe in emotional fitness: awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. 
For the community, we believe a human is more than just the individual, and is part of something larger.  As individuals we are a global community in a close, interconnected network of people. 
In an ever increasing digital world, we still see the utmost importance in bringing people together physically. Our stores are designed to be multi-functional spaces promoting community where people can not only shop, but learn, grow, and connect with each other. 

==================
business problem
==================
The goal of this challenge is to use your ideas to expand the concept of what a lululemon store is and could be.We want individuals and the larger community to leave our stores enriched and better than they were before entering.
These spaces offer configurability and an opportunity to regularly connect with individuals on variable cadences. What these hubs offer now will continue to evolve as the needs of the collective continues to evolve. And most importantly, we don’t take ourselves too seriously at lululemon.  While wellbeing can be serious business, we believe that true wellbeing can only be achieved if we don’t sweat the small stuff and instead, infuse fun and enjoyment in all we do.
