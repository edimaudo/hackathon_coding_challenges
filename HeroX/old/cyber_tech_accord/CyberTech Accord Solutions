cyber tech accord solutions

###################
Overview
###################
21st century challenges need 21st century solutions, especially when it comes to creating a safer and a more secure online world. Amidst escalating numbers of sophisticated cyberattacks, it is clear that bringing greater security and stability to cyberspace will require new and different ideas compared to what has worked in other domains of conflict, and collaboration across disciplines.

###################
Problem
###################
People are not aware of the cybersecurity risks.  New malicious products are being created everyday.  Also cyber security education is all over the place and involves understanding of different systems.

------------------
Overview
------------------
The platform would help in digital capacity building by providing access to information which can help citizens stay secure, it would also help in teaching people how to gain the right skills in order to build the tools that would help people to be digitally secure.  Lastly, it would have a an app that would help keep safe online and prevent malicious software from impacting their devices.

------------------
Learning Platform Overview
------------------
A curated set of reading material that would help users keep their gadgets, tools and smart devices safe
- How to stay safe online
- Keep up with good security hygiene
- Actions to take now to reduce the pain of getting hacked
- Actions to take when hacked
- Insurance products that could be used
- cyber dojo - how to become a certified white hat hacker

------------------
Platform details
------------------
It will have a set of lessons that teach users how to secure their mobile devices, iot devices, browse the web safely, steps to take to prevent being hacked, steps to take after being hacked.  This will be courses on the platform.  
It will also have a section on lessons that will help with security credential certifications such as crisp
It will also have a section on how to use different security tools, understanding technology from a hacker perspective and how to gain knowledge of it
It will have a game section that will help solidify these concepts using capture the flag, cryptographic competitions, finding security vulnerabilities, timed hacks and other puzzles.
It will also have a section where you can download an app that will help keep your mobile device secure using machine learning techniques to scan for viruses and weird apps that may be collecting data

App
------------------
 - have an app that would tell people how to keep themselves safe + it would also scan other apps for vulnerabilities
 Have an app that would notify you about malicious apps + it would give you daily insights into how to keep your self protected + new dangers and how they can protect themselves.  It would have to be in really simple form
