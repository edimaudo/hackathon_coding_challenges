## Overview
In celebration of the Chirp Developer Conference, we’re hosting the Chirp Developer Challenge! 
Share your innovative experiences built with the Twitter API v2 for community recognition and prizes valued at over $520,000. Submit your app now through August 19th for your chance to be featured at Chirp. 
Help us unlock new experiences for people on Twitter, and inspire other developers. We want to push the boundaries of what’s possible with our platform. We need your help to bring to life the experiences that will define this new frontier.

## REQUIREMENTS
Build an app using the Twitter API v2 in one of the following categories and must also use at least one of the corresponding endpoints per category;

### Content discovery apps
Help people discover content such as Lists, Spaces, Bookmarks, or Tweets, on Twitter. We have built an open platform that allows you to give people more opportunities to discover content that’s relevant to them. While we built some discovery experiences ourselves (such as the Explore tab for Spaces), people will benefit from alternative discovery mechanisms that can complement ours or be an alternative to them. Another element of discovery is the ability to create different perspectives of the public conversation. Our products enable you to build ways to filter content by a particular set of rules (for example, a specific topic), or to only surface content in a particular context (such as time of day). You can build tools to show relevant content based on those circumstances, such as apps that surface work-related content during the week, and fun content during the weekend.
- Bookmarks
- Search
- Spaces
- Manage Tweets
- Lists
- Timelines
- Filtered Stream

### Conversation safety tools
Help people feel more safe on Twitter. We want everyone to feel comfortable, safe, and excited to participate in the conversation on Twitter. We’ve worked hard to offer tools that give people more control over their experience, like Tweet reply settings, blocks, and mutes. However, there will always be more work to do, and we want to encourage you to build complementary or additive solutions that help improve the health and safety of the platform. For instance, apps that actively limit the content you don’t want to see/experience. Or filter unwanted content, mentions, and/or profiles.
Must use at least one of the following Twitter API v2 endpoints; 
- Search with Conversation ID
- Timelines
- Follows
- Blocks
- Mutes
- Hide replies
- Manage Tweets (Tweet reply settings)

### Public good apps
Connect to real world issues, supporting people outside of the Twitter experience. We want to bring communities closer during real world events. Help people coordinate emergencies, tweet out vital information, or help people find assistance when they need it. Keep people safe and informed with tools to automatically share information like extreme weather updates, public health notices, or distributing information in times of crisis and more.
Must use at least one Twitter API v2 endpoint.
