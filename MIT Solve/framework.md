## Problem Statement
Care work is ubiquitous and essential. Paid and unpaid carers support over one billion people, including children under 6, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. High-quality care encourages early childhood development, enables a higher quality of life, and provides meaningful work. Yet today, most care work globally is unpaid or undervalued, and disproportionately falls on women and girls. 

## Objective
The goal is to help care workers pursue safe and secure work, and make care for young children, the elderly, and people with disabilities accessible and affordable in all contexts. The solution will be able to address the following problems
- Improve access to training and certifications, 
- Ensure decent working conditions and basic rights for care workers
- Establish care work as a broadly respected profession, including reducing stereotypes around gender roles
- Enable new models for childcare or eldercare that improve affordability, convenience, and community trust.
