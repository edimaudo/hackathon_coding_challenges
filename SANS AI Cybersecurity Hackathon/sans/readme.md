## SANS AI Hackathon

### About
Join us for the AI Cybersecurity Hackathon—a global virtual competition that tests both your creativity and your technical expertise. From February 15th to March 15th, you’ll have the chance to develop and showcase AI-driven solutions aimed at securing systems, protecting sensitive data, and countering emerging cyber threats.

Whether you’re a seasoned cybersecurity professional or a student exploring the intersection of AI and security, this hackathon offers you the chance to:

Make a real-world impact through AI innovation
Sharpen your cybersecurity and machine learning skills
Connect with a vibrant global community of forward-thinking developers

### Solution
This project focus on Predictive Analytics for System Resilience: Use time-series analysis or predictive modeling to forecast system failures or potential attack vectors, helping organizations shore up defenses in advance.
