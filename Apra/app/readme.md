## The Challenge:

Organizational Context

Itâ€™s that time again! Hard to think that after a quick interregnum, your organization is ready to start a new fundraising campaign. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to instruct Executive Staff on the goals of that campaign.  

### Research Questions

Below are some questions you and your team may choose to consider as you work through this challenge. These are only meant to be suggested starting points, and you are encouraged to take your analysis in any direction you see fit:

- What gifts bands are predictable and steadily performing? Are any of them performing worse over time?

- What does the donor base look like? What types of donors show steady, predicatable patterns?

- Are there donor segments that are not under management where we might want to assign a gift officer?

- Forecast giving trends and identify the donor segments with the most growth potential for the upcoming year.
