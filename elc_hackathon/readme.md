# ELC Hackathon

## HACK FOR ACCESSIBILITY
One billion people, or 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability, such as vision, mobility, auditory or neurological. The 2021 Estée Lauder Companies Virtual Hackathon, Hack4A11y is focused on developing accessible and inclusive solutions to help tackle challenges that people with disabilities face on a daily basis. Accessibility is about making sure that everyone can partake in what the world has to offer. It’s about all of us.

Among the most important current trends in technology is the concept of user experience (UX), which focuses on improving technology’s effectiveness and ease of use. Today, technology accessibility is fundamental for ensuring a positive user experience. What will you develop to create a more inclusive and accessible experience for all?
