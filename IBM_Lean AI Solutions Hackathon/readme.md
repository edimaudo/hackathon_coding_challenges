## Overview

In this hackathon, you must use IBM® Granite™ to build a proof-of-concept solution to align with one out of two possible themes. Granite is IBM's family of fit for purpose and open-source AI models designed for exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. IBM latest Granite 3.3 represents another expansion of IBM Granite's multimodal footprint. Headlined by Granite Speech 8B, our first official speech-totext model, Granite 3.3 marks the beginning of our explorations into audio capabilities. Alongside the recent addition of vision and reasoning capabilities, IBM continues to grow the versatility of the Granite series across the enterprise use cases that customers and the open source community need most. You may use any version of Granite for this competition. Review the two theme options and choose the one your team wants to address with your solution:

### Make work less boring
This is your chance to show the world what “different” could look like when it comes to business. Use IBM Granite models and build a proof-of-concept, AI-driven solution that brings creativity into how businesses operate. Whether it's generating new ideas, designing creative content, predicting innovation or market trends, enhancing brainstorming processes, or nurturing creative strategy, you'll identify an activity that can be improved and build a solution that can empower businesses to innovate faster and more creatively.

### Decent work and economic growth challenge, brought to you by Call for Code
Economic growth and decent work can be a positive force for the whole planet. We're calling on you to build a proof-of-concept, AI-driven solution using IBM Granite models that can address an issue that falls under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
