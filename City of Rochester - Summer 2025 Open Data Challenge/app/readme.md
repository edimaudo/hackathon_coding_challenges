# City of Rochester 2025 Open Data Challenge

## Overview
The challenge invites you to use our publicly available datasets on Rochesterâ€™s parks and bike trails to make an innovate map, visualization, dashboard, story map, infographic, web site, or web app.  You have free reign to let your imagination and creativity run wild.  Some digital tool ideas include analyzing the impact and importance of parks to surrounding neighborhoods and community members, mapping recommended bike trails, how accessible parks and green spaces are across the cities, or creating a picture-based tour of different parks or trails.
