## About TechJam 2021

HCL, as the Official Digital Technology Partner of Cricket Australia, has been working to scale digital transformation, inspire exceptional experiences, and build a future-ready technology foundation that will empower Cricket Australia (CA) to inspire love for the game across communities and the ecosystem. 

Now, in the bid to bring more technology-driven ideas to the forefront, we are delighted to announce the HCL-CA TechJam 2021 #InspiredByHCL - a unique opportunity for today's innovators to help reimagine Cricket like never before. TechJam provides access to compelling data sets and insights from the Cricket ecosystem and covers a wide spectrum of interesting challenges across Player Performance, Fan Engagement and Community Engagement from the grassroots to the international level.

TechJam is a global collaboration platform to crowdsource technology led innovations from the brightest minds across the global to develop implementable solutions and prototypes to transform the game of Cricket on and off the field. With an esteemed jury comprising of industry leaders from Cricket Australia, Microsoft, Global Sports Innovation Center and HCL's partners, the winners stand a chance to win great menetary rewards, and an opportunity to win exclusive rewards and recognition from Cricket Australia and partner organizations. 

TechJam: #InspiredByHCL is open for registrations from around the globe and will start on June 14, 2021 and continue until September 2, 2021. Projects can be submitted as early as July 22, 2021, and you will have 6 weeks to learn, dive into the datasets and take a swing at winning the $40,000 prize pool! Additionally, you will have an opportunity to win exclusive rewards and recognition from Cricket Australia and partner organizations. 

Challenges
TechJam: #InspiredByHCL will focus on three challenge tracks and will provide data and insights that teams can leverage: Player and Team Performance, Fan Engagement and Community Engagement. Additionally, since there is a lot of scope for innovation, participants are also encouraged to submit ideas that have the potential to make an impact on the sport and can fall under the wild card submission category. 

### Challenge #1: Player Performance

Are you passionate about sports? Do you get excited about your favorite player improving every year and bringing your team one step closer to winning a championship? If so, this challenge is for you!

This challenge requires looking for solutions that leverage historical player performance data to improve performance on the field and improve the sport of Cricket in Australia and internationally. Challenge yourself and create a solution that meaningfully impacts the game of Cricket and improves the overall win rate and performance of Cricket teams on and off the field.

#### Challenge themes

- BBL to International: Compare performance of the Australian team
to that of international matches to gain insight. With this example
solution, the goal is to create a project that gives Cricket Australia
the extra edge that they need to win all of their matches!

- MoneyBall Approach: Determine key performance indicators that
lead to winning, help teams recruit and select top performers and
rank players based on performance in key areas. Instead of creating
a simple ranking system that ranks players statistically, youâ€™ll have
access to multiple data sets that take a deep dive into individual
aspects of the game that will provide a clearer understanding of the
key performance indicators. 

- Form Factor: Determine how data can be leveraged to identify areas
of improvement for player performance and how that data can be
used to determine success in the future. Previous win/loss statistics
may not be a key factor to gauge success in the future. Therefore,
you will need to analyze ball-by-ball data and other data sets to help
layout a use case for how the Cricket Australia team can be more
successful in the upcoming seasons.

- Real Time Strategy: Determine strategies to help mitigate a player
being dismissed from game play using data. For example, your
solution can build algorithms to predict the chances of a batsman
getting out given a sequence of deliveries

- Match Strategy: Given that there are different types of Cricket matches that
can be played, define optimal match strategies using the data provided to
help teams prepare more effectively. Keep in mind that during these
different types of matches, both the batting and bowling teams will need
effective strategies in order to be successful.

- DRS: Improve on field performance by leveraging umpire, grounds and
match data to make decision-making easier for cricket players and leaders.
The idea behind this solution is to highlight areas where umpires, and
possibly even the team captains, are making the wrong decisions so that we
can better prepare them for future matches.

- Prototype: Prototypes and technology solutions to build end-to-end
integrated digital applications to manage and coordinate players, travel,
partner engagements, payments and appearances. You will also want to
consider the aspects of player training to ensure better coordination and
management of the Australian National Team.


### Challenge #2: Fan Engagement

As the world begins to recover from the COVID-19 crisis, the way fans engage and interact with cricket matches and teams has been redefined. There are significant issues to be addressed to ensure the safety of matches, and to improve overall fan engagement across social media platforms, TV and in the arena.

This challenge requires participants to put themselves in the shoes of fans and create a technology-based solution that simultaneously manages fan expectations, improves fan experiences, minimizes operational disruption and helps fans plan for the future of Cricket. Using data and other resources, you will be required to strategize and implement a solution to bring real-time data to fans across multiple channels, improving their overall experience and keeps them coming back for more. 

### Challenge #3: Community Engagement

Sports bring people together and make people happy, invigorated and inspired. It's not only about watching the sport and hoping your team wins, it's about engaging, communicating and enlightening each other as a community that includes sports fans, organizations, volunteers and future players. How do we improve overall community engagement to increase growth for the future of Cricket? 

With this challenge, we are looking for disruptive solutions that leverage cutting-edge technologies to increase participation rates, identify young talent, optimize resources and tools to enable the community and make Cricket more inclusive for everyone across Australia and internationally. 

### Challenge #4: Wildcard

This is the open innovation challenge track, in which you are welcome to come up with your own idea and submit for the TechJam - only if you do not see a solution listed that you would like to work on.

If you go this route, the best practice is to first run your idea by a mentor for the TechJam to get some feedback and make sure you are still creating something that is relevant for the TechJam. Be sure to mention on your project page that you spoke to the mentor and discuss how you came up with your creative solutions.
