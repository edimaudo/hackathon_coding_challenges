üß© 1. Add an AI/ML Element
Why: Opens eligibility for the "AI" category and boosts technical depth.
How:

- Recommend libraries to users based on proximity + interests + borrowing patterns.
- Use clustering to find "library activity zones" or underserved regions.

üå± 2. Add a Social/Sustainability Lens
Why: Unlocks "Sustainability" or "Social Impact" category.
How:
- Highlight access gaps in marginalized neighborhoods.
- Show current programs, exhibitions, and community events

üé® 3. Improve Visual Storytelling
Why: Elevates score under ‚ÄúArt of the Map‚Äù and ‚ÄúContent & Visualization‚Äù.
How:
- Ditch the default map. Use the Google Maps Cloud-based map styling to create a unique theme. A vintage, blueprint, or dark-mode style that matches the "tour" aesthetic would be highly effective.
- Data-Driven Markers: Instead of using the same pin for every library, make the markers themselves convey information.
Size: The circle's radius could represent the annual number of visitors or collection size.
Color: The color could represent a specific metric, like the number of programs offered (e.g., green for many, yellow for some, red for few). This turns the map into an instant-read dashboard.
- Create Guided Tours: Instead of a passive map, create narrative-driven tours. A user could select a "tour" like "A Walk Through Toronto's Historic Libraries" or "Top 5 Libraries for Students." Clicking "Start" would programmatically pan and zoom the map between these locations, opening the info card for each one, creating an engaging, story-like experience.
- Historical timeline feature showing Toronto library evolution
- Architectural tours highlighting unique building features
- Use animated paths (MapLibre or Google Maps animation tools) to show visits.
- Cluster markers, color-code by traffic/usage or programs.
- Use aerial view transitions or 3D buildings for featured libraries.
- Use heatmaps to show usage patterns or popular times

üöÄ 4. Enhance UX and Navigation
Why: Stronger "User Experience" and "Functionality" scores.
How:
Solve a User Problem: Go beyond just showing locations. Add filters that help users find the right library for their needs. For example:
 - "Show me libraries with 3D printers."
 - "Find libraries with dedicated quiet study zones."
 - "Which libraries are open now?
- Use Marker Clustering: Toronto has many libraries. In dense areas, the markers will overlap. Use the Marker Clustering utility to group nearby markers into a single, numbered icon, cleaning up the UI and showing density at a glance.
- Add filters (by program type, branch size, hours).
- Include animations on card open/close.
- Mobile-first touch navigation with full-width flyouts for card info.

üìà 5. Connect with Live Data
Why: Boosts Technical Execution and Functionality.
How:
- Show current hours, events today, etc. using Toronto's Open API or scraping.
