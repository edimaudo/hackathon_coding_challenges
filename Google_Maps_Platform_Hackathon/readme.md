## Google Maps Platform Hackathon

Build with the power of Google Maps Platform.

Elevate everything you build 
Google Maps Platform allows developers to create unique location-based experiences using our APIs & SDKs. Now is your chance to build or expand an existing app to incorporate rich location experiences using the latest APIs and push the boundaries of what is possible with our platform.

In this hackathon we invite you to use Google Maps Platform APIs and SDKs. Build a unique app in one of the following categories.

**Map Customization**
Use Cloud-based map styling to create custom map styles for real-time updates across all devices and platforms. The new Cloud-based map styling makes it easy to tailor experiences for specific industries or customer needs with hundreds of customization types.
See examples and more details about how to customize your map.

**Data Visualization**
Let data tell a unique story. Help make decisions and improve overall operational efficiencies by displaying data on your map. 
See examples and learn more about how to visualize data on a map.

**Mobile App**
Use Google Maps Platform mobile SDKs to connect your mobile app and the real world. Leverage mobile SDKs to build dynamic, interactive, geospatial experiences for your mobile app.
See the available SDKs.

**User Experience**
Provide a unique experience for your app users with Google Maps Platform APIs and tools. Whether itâ€™s unique transit information, a delivery game, or beyond, discover the breadth of capabilities Google Maps Platform has to offer.

Join the Discord community, explore the resources, and start building. With your Google Cloud account, you get $200 of Google Maps Platform credit at no charge every month.

We look forward to seeing what you build with our platform.
