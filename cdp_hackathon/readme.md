## Challenge 1: City-Business Collaboration

To identify opportunities for companies and cities to collaborate on sustainability solutions, we need to first understand how the data they each report is aligned or divergent by using data science and text analytics techniques.

1. Utilize data science and text analytics techniques to improve readability of the data.
2. Visualize shared sentiment between cities and companies on specific topics (such as clean energy, sustainable buildings, clean transport, waste and circular economy).
3. Create a KPI model that measures the propensity of cities to collaborate with companies. Provide the justification of your weights and indicators
