Stewart's passion for photography began with the discovery of a Bakelite developing tank in the basement of his family home in Montreal. Used in pre-digital days to process 35mm film negatives, the tank belonged to Stewart's father who used the opportunity to teach Stewart the basics of film photography including darkroom techniques. Stewart's 'darkroom' is now his computer, and the magic of photography is still as thrilling as ever. <br /><br />""I had never heard of Grand Manan Island until I visited there in 2013. Grand Manan is in the Bay of Fundy and is a jewel of an island, steeped in Maritime history and rich in natural beauty with abundant birds and sea life and varied geography. Grand Manan is the antithesis of touristy and its weathered heritage structures, active fishing community and interesting characters draw me back year after year."" <br /><br />This exhibit is part of TPL's <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/exhibits/art-exhibit-space.jsp"">Art Exhibit Space</a> program.

She holds an MFA in Interdisciplinary Art, Media and Design from OCADU and a BFA in painting and drawing from Concordia. Her work is influenced by research into ancestral and generational inheritance, the Sephardic Diaspora, mindfulness meditation and trauma healing. Gladstone is a member of the Objective Collective. She has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally. <br /><br />""The work submitted for this exhibition is part of a new series of abstract paintings that depicts the process of daily meditation; depicting an internal map of thought process, emotional states, and intuition. Each painting makes use of gesture, vibrant mark making and a layered process of removal, erasure, and embellishment of the original mark, so as to explore the passage of time on memory, and the fleetingness of thoughts and feelings. Using the language of abstraction, these works make use of the metaphor of weather and cloud forms. Much of my past work has explored weather patterns through a sublime aesthetic, blending Romantic landscape painting with Modernist abstraction. These influences can be felt, along with an intuition of mark making that is fresh and personal and conveys to the viewer, the richness of the inner world when we learn to drop the noise of our thoughtforms."" <br /><br />This exhibit is part of TPL's <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/exhibits/art-exhibit-space.jsp"">Art Exhibit Space</a> program.

643,Casey McQuiston: The Pairing,2024-09-04,,7:00 PM,8:00 PM,Toronto Reference Library,Bram & Bluma Appel Salon,"Casey McQuiston, New York Times bestselling author of Red, White and Royal Blue, joins us to discuss their wildly anticipated new romantic comedy about two bisexual exes who accidentally book the same European food and wine tour. Before the talk, get crafty and dream up your next vacation by creating a customized collage tote bag inspired by a summer of European travel as a part of a special pre-show event.<br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.raincoastgroup.com/item/9781250862747"">The Pairing</a>, we meet Theo and Kit, a pair of estranged exes who exited each other's lives after a brutal breakup on the transatlantic flight to their dream European food and wine tour.<br /><br />In the years since, Theo has found confidence as a hustling bartender by night and aspiring sommelier by day. Kit, who never returned to America, now bakes at one of the finest restaurants in Paris. All that remains of their relationship is the unused voucher for the European tour that never happened. Four years later, it seems like a great idea to finally take the trip. Solo. Separately.<br /><br />It's not until they board the tour bus that they discover they've both accidentally had the exact same idea, and now they're trapped with each other for three weeks of stunning views, luscious flavors, and the most romantic cities of France, Spain, and Italy. It's fine. There's nothing left between them. So much nothing that they challenge each other to a hookup competition to prove they're over each other.<br /><br />But sometimes a taste of everything only makes you crave what you can't have.<br /><br />Casey McQuiston speaks with journalist and author Rachel Giese about The Pairing, a magnetic 'exes-to-lovers' story steeped in the irresistible flavours of a European summer.<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow. Books available for purchase.<br /><br />About the DIY Travel Tote Bag Pre-Show: Need a new favourite tote to take on your next trip, pack for a beach day, or carry your current read? Starting at 6 pm, join Victoria Stacey of The Neighbourhood Market for a special pre-show event to create a customized collage tote bag.

But inside its borders, the old myths of trees that come alive and faeries who live among their roots have given way to an explosion of the arts and the consolations of philosophy. No one, from the clarinetists to the cabaret singers, is as revered in the arts as Sofia's brilliant mother, the writer Clara Bottom. How can 14 year old Sofia, with a tin ear and an enduring love of the old myths, ever hope to win her mother's love?<br /><br />When the country's greatest enemy invades, and the Capital is under threat, at last Clara turns to her daughter. Sofia must smuggle her new manuscript to safety on the last train evacuating children from the city. But the train draws to a suspicious halt in the middle of a forest, and Sofia must run for her life, losing her mother's most prized possession. Now frightened and alone in a country at war, Sofia must find a way to reclaim what she has lost. On an epic journey through woods and razed towns, colliding with soldiers, survivors and other lost children, Sofia must make the choice between kindness and survival.<br /><br />Heather O'Neill speaks with award-winning writer Emma Donoghue about The Capital of Dreams, a novel that once again reveals that she is a master of language.<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

Enberg and St. Anne's Survivor, Evelyn Korkmaz. Residential School Survivor and peer advocacy worker Michael Cheena will open and close the event. <br /><br />No registration required. This event is taking place on the ground floor of the building in Beeton Hall. <br /><br />In Jesus' Name:  Shattering the Silence of St. Anne's Residential School is a poignant all Indigenous English and Cree documentary, and it breaks long-held silences imposed upon children who were interned at the notoriously violent St. Annes Residential School in Fort Albany First Nation, Ontario. First Nations children from all over the western James Bay region suffered isolation from family and community as well as physical, sexual, spiritual and cultural abuse at the hands of the Catholic Oblates of Mary Immaculate and the Sisters of Charity. Some were abused by other students who had learned violent behaviours from their 'caregivers.' <br /><br />***<br />Susan Enberg is a documentary producer, photographer, and editor living in Toronto. She is primarily concerned with shedding light on egregious human rights abuses. Most of Susan's work to date has been with Survivors of the notoriously violent St. Anne's Residential School that was located in Fort Albany First Nation.<br /><br />Evelyn Korkmaz is an Indigenous Cree Survivor of St. AnneÂs Residential School. Ms. Korkmaz advocates passionately for survivors of the Indian Residential School System and is committed to educating Canadians by sharing her personal experiences through public speaking engagements. Evelyn is a founding member of Ending Clergy Abuse and Advocates for Clergy Trauma Survivors in Canada has presented and testified before various committees at the United Nations. A member of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation Treaty #9 territory, Ms. Korkmaz occupies a pivotal role within the Nikanigawbowin Council.<br /><br />Michael Cheena is First Nation with Cree ancestry from James Bay. He has held several leading roles in native communities in Ontario, including being a former President of Toronto Council Fire Native Cultural Centre Board of Directors.  Michael received the Commemorative Medal for the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada in recognition of voluntary service. A survivor of two residential schools, Michael has shared his residential school experience with non-Indigenous Canadians. Michael is currently a Peer Advocacy Worker for IRSS at the Toronto Council Fire Native Cultural Centre.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Content Warning: This program features information about residential schools and personal accounts of residential school experiences. The National Indian Residential School Crisis Line (1-866-925-4419) is available 24/7 for Survivors and their families who are experiencing pain or distress as a result their experience in residential schools.

On the surface she seems to live a good life with her wife Nira and teenage son, Mateo. But there is so much left unsaid.<br /><br />It's not until Infamous' last episode features the Scarborough Stalker that she remembers coming of age while the serial rapist and killer was attacking women and girls in Scarborough in the late 80s and early 90s.<br /><br />What unfolds are two storylines: In the past, young Alma watches an entire city become consumed with a manhunt for an elusive, terrifying suspect, while she herself is in jeopardy from closer corners. In the present, adult Alma must come to terms with her own ideas of consent to stop her son's dangerous behaviour towards his girlfriend.<br /><br />Catherine Hernandez speaks with writer and cultural critic Stacy Lee Kong about Behind You, a moving story of one girl's resilience into adulthood and a chilling portrayal of the insidiousness of rape culture. <br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

LassÃ© par la vie parisienne dans laquelle il ne trouve dÃ©cidÃ©ment pas sa place, en quÃªte d'un hypothÃ©tique Paradis terrestre, Gauguin y effectue deux voyages, en 1891, puis dÃ©finitivement en 1895. Adoptant le mode de vie des Maoris, il transpose leurs croyances en des tableaux Ã©lÃ©giaques, oÃ¹ se mÃªlent lÃ©gendes tahitiennes et symboles chrÃ©tiens. Marchant sur ses pas, Matisse se rend en 1930 Ã  Tahiti oÃ¹ il rencontre le cinÃ©aste expressionniste allemand Murnau. Ãbloui par la splendeur des paysages, Matisse en revient mÃ©tamorphosÃ© ; les impressions colorÃ©es qu'il en rapporte seront la source de ses ultimes chefs-d'oeuvre.<br /><br />La confÃ©rence est proposÃ©e par Gilles Genty, historien de l'art et  fait partie d'un premier cycle intitulÃ© Les artistes voyageurs ; nouveaux horizons, nouvelle inspiration ! <br /><br />En collaboration avec Alliance FranÃ§aise de Toronto.<br /><br />CrÃ©dit photo : Margot Richard.<br /> <br /><br />****<br /><br /><br />Cet Ã©vÃ©nement sera enregistrÃ© et va Ãªtre disponible en rediffusion via le mÃªme lien.<br /><br /><br />****<br /><br />La BibliothÃ¨que publique de Toronto s'engage Ã  l'accessibilitÃ©.

Lyn has her pottery artwork, her precocious kid and the uncertain terrain of her midlife to keep her mind, heart and hands busy. June, a MÃ©tis Studies professor, yearns to uproot from Vancouver and move. With her loving partner, June decides to buy a house in the last place on earth she imagined she'd end up: back home in Winnipeg with her family.<br /><br />But then into lyn and June's busy lives a bomb drops: their estranged and very white mother, Renee, is called out as a ""pretendian."" Under the name (get this) Raven Bearclaw, Renee had topped the charts in the Canadian art world for winning awards and recognition for her Indigenous-style work.<br /><br />The news is quickly picked up by the media and sparks an enraged online backlash. As the sisters are pulled into the painful tangle of lies their mother has told and the hurt she has caused, searing memories from their unresolved childhood trauma, which still manages to spill into their well curated adult worlds, come rippling to the surface.<br /><br />katherena vermette speaks with Elamin Abdelmahmoud, host of CBC Radio's COMMOTION, about real ones, an energetic, probing and ultimately hopeful story that pays homage to the long-fought, hard-won battles of Michif (MÃ©tis) people to regain ownership of their identity and the right to say who is and isn't MÃ©tis.<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

In his recently released memoir, <a href=""https://www.dundurn.com/books_/t22117/a9781459748903-my-name-is-not-harry"">My Name is not Harry</a>, Siddiqui traces his journey from India to Canada; And his extraordinary career that took him from warzones to the corridors of power in Canada.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Canada in the late 1960s, Siddiqui did what many newly arrived immigrants would not dare do - he refused to change who he was. It was this unabashed self-confidence and sense of dignity that made him a champion of multiculturalism and a pioneer of cross-cultural journalism. And as the world started to become increasingly Anti-Muslim after 9/11, Siddiqui was one of the first Canadian journalists to interrogate the real motivations behind ""the war on terror"".<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

This month's title is Colonization Road (2016) by Michelle St. John.<br /><br />Synopsis: In towns throughout Ontario, there are startling reminders of the colonization of Indigenous territories and the displacement of First Nations people. Anishinaabe comedian and activist Ryan McMahon takes us to his hometown of Fort Frances and down its main drag, which is called Colonization Road. Similar streets have similar names in towns and cities across the province, direct reminders of the Public Lands Act of 1853 and its severe impact on First Nations, their treaties and their land in the name of ""Canadian settlement."" On his journey through Ontario, McMahon explores the history of these roads, meets with settlers in solidarity and raises significant questions about ""reconciliation"" and what it means to ""decolonize.""<br /><br />Optional registration here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sr-festival-select-colonization-road-tickets-986022589107?aff=oddtdtcreator",https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEVT515317&R=EVT515317,515317,0,00-Culture Arts & Entertainment,None,None,Adult,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,2024-08-10T11:26:02Z

Smith,None,"Join the <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/osborne/""> Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books</a> for our 17th Annual Sybille Pantazzi Memorial Lecture: Unboxing Creativity by the <a href="" https://www.thefanbrothers.com/""> Fan Brothers </a>.<br /><br />The Fan Brothers - Terry, Eric, and Devin Fan are brothers, writers and artists who have been dreaming up stories and characters together since they were young. ""Barnaby Unboxed!"" is the follow-up to ""The Barnabus Project"", winner of the Governor General's Literary Award and the TD Canadian Children's Literature Award, among many other honors, and published in almost twenty languages. Terry and Eric are author-illustrators of ""The Night Gardener"", ""Ocean Meets Sky"", ""It Fell from the Sky"", and ""Lizzy and the Cloud"". Devin is a youth worker who has a passion for nature, poetry and kung fu. All three brothers live by the edge of a lake in Ontario, Canada, and daydream about stories during long walks by the water.<br /><br />In October's lecture the Fan Brothers will discuss their creative process, from initial inspiration, to working on the final book. Their latest book, ""Barnaby Unboxed!"", is Terry and Eric's fifth book as both writers and artists, and Devin's second book. Over the course of making those books, a pattern emerged as to how they approach the creative process. Every writer and artist faces the same challenge when confronted with the blank page. Where do stories and ideas come from? As three brothers, working collectively, that challenge comes with its own unique set of hurdles, and also benefits. Sometimes, it turns out, three heads are better than one. <br /><br />Fan Brothers (photo credit Michelle Quance)<br /><br />Books will be available for sale by <a href=""http://www.beguilingbooksandart.com/7802-2/"">Little Island Comics</a> at the event.<br /><br />This free event will be held on the lower level of the <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/lillianhsmith/""> Lillian H.

Forcefully argued, accessible, and witty, What She Said explores a range of issues: the increasingly hostile world of threats that deter young women from seeking a role in public life; the use of non disclosure agreements to silence victims of sexual harassment and assault; the inadequacy of access to health care and reproductive justice, especially as experienced by Indigenous and racialized women; the ways in which future technologies must be made more inclusive; the disparity in pay, wealth, and savings, and how women are not yet socialized to be the best financial managers they can be; the imbalanced burden of care, from emotional labour to child care. What She Said is a rallying cry for a more just future.<br /><br />In conversation with journalist Scaachi Khoul.<br /><br />Q & A and book signing to follow.

New trends in romance include the explosion of Romantasy (a blend of romance and fantasy), the inclusion of speculative elements into contemporary stories, and stories set outside major US cities. Also non-white, non-Eurocentric world views are finally entering the mainstream. In this panel discussion, Farah will speak to 3 debut authors Alina Khawaja, Kate Robb and Kay Costales about breaking into a changing genre with stories that would not have been possible before. 30 minute Q&A follows.<br /><br />Join writer Farah Heron, Toronto Public Library's Fall 2024 Writer in Residence, as she engages you in this fascinating and informative talk on romance fiction at North York Central Library.<br /><br />This event is part of TPL's <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/writer-in-residence"">Writer in Residence</a> program. The residency is designed to encourage exchanges between the author and the community and the Writer in Residence will be delivering workshops and evaluating manuscripts of aspiring writers who submit their work.  <br /> <br />To register, please call 416-395-5639.<br /><br />Accessibility<br />Toronto Public Library is committed to accessibility.

How would it feel to receive a hormone injection that drastically improved your cognitive function? What if learning an alien language changed the way you perceived time? And if humanity were to create artificial life, what obligations would we owe it? Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth - What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human? - and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.<br /><br />In conversation with author Kelly Robson.<br /><br />Q & A and book signing to follow.

2674,Jeanne Beker: Stories from a Life Well Worn,2024-10-29,,7:00 PM,8:00 PM,North York Central Library,Concourse Event Space,"Fashion and style icon Jeanne Beker discusses her new memoir and walks us through a wardrobe of memory, one article of clothing at a time.<br /><br />Jeanne Beker's name is synonymous with style and grace in fashion, recognized by many as the beloved host of Fashion Television. Now, in <a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/Heart-on-My-Sleeve/Jeanne-Beker/9781668035207"">Heart on My Sleeve</a>, Jeanne reveals who she is in an all-new way.<br /><br />This is not just a memoir but a wardrobe of memory. Jeanne walks us through her recollections of specific pieces of clothing and jewelry, precious items that have made an indelible impact on her. She invites readers to think more deeply about how what we wear - whether it's a thrift-store find or high-end couture - acts as a touchstone to our most treasured recollections, reminding us of who we once were or of loved ones we hold dear.<br /><br />With Jeanne as our style guide, we get up-close and personal with a star-studded cast, including Paul McCartney, Madonna, Karl Lagerfeld, Kate Moss, Oscar de la Renta, BeyoncÃ©, and Keith Richards. But equally important, Jeanne introduces us to the family members and loved ones who form her closest entourage - including her wise Yiddish mother and her industrious father, both Holocaust survivors; her childhood neighbor Mrs. Jaskolka, a style maven ahead of her time; her two trailblazing daughters; and her many warm and exuberant friends who have seen her through the best and worst of times.<br /><br />Jeanne Beker speaks with Melissa Grelo, co-host of CTV's The Social, about Heart on My Sleeve, a bold, colourful, and authentic memoir that proves that a life lived with style and substance is always in fashion. <br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

He was from Canada and soon, he was the perfect fake boyfriend. He became her get-out-of-jail-free card for all kinds of sticky situations. He was just what she needed to cover her social awkwardness and he never had to know. It wasn't like she was ever going to see him again.<br /><br />Years later, Aurora is teaching kids' dance classes and battling panic and eating disorders--souvenirs from her failed ballet career--when pro hockey player Mike Martin walks in with his daughter. Mike's honesty about his struggles with widowhood helps Aurora confront some of her own demons, and the two forge an unlikely friendship. There's just one problem: Mike is the boy she spent years pretending was her ""Canadian boyfriend."" The longer she keeps her secret, the more she knows it will shatter the trust between them. But to have the life she wants, she needs to tackle the most important thing of all: believing in herself.<br /><br />This program requires registraion.

Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables through the Years: Texts, Covers, Readers by <a href="" https://benjaminlefebvre.com/""> Benjamin Lefebvre </a>.<br /><br />Benjamin Lefebvre (he/him) lives in Kitchener and directs the web resource L.M. Montgomery Online. His books include an edition of L.M. Montgomery's rediscovered final book, ""The Blythes Are Quoted"" (Penguin Canada), and the award-winning three-volume critical anthology ""The L.M. Montgomery Reader"" (University of Toronto Press). Current projects include editing volumes of Montgomery's shorter works for University of Toronto Press, most recently ""Twice upon a Time: Selected Stories, 1898 - 1939"". In 2022, he published his first novel, ""In the Key of Dale"" (Arsenal Pulp Press). <br /><br />In this lecture, Lefebvre will discuss how the text of L.M. Montgomery's first and most famous book, ""Anne of Green Gables"", has largely stayed the same since it was published in 1908. But everything else-from cover designs to the technologies people use to read and discuss books-has changed immeasurably since then. In this lecture, novelist and scholar Benjamin Lefebvre shares some of the discoveries he has made throughout his many years as a Montgomery scholar and offers new insights about this perennially popular book, how it fits within Montgomery's lifetime body of work, and how it continues to be reprinted today.<br /><br />Benjamin Lefebvre (photo credit Kassandra Fritz)<br /><br />This free event will be held on the lower level of the <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/lillianhsmith/""> Lillian H.

In this gemlike volume, she selects her best poems from across fifty years, beginning with her early discoveries of her own voice and ending with moving reflections on our contemporary moment. Generous notes on each poem offer insight into Harjo's inimitable poetics as she takes inspiration from Navajo horse songs and jazz, reckons with home and loss, and listens to the natural messengers of the earth.<br /><br />Joy Harjo speaks with multidisciplinary artist Jessica Lea Fleming about her musical, intimate, political, and wise writing, which intertwines ancestral memory and tribal histories with resilience and love that speaks ""from a deep and timeless source of compassion for all"" (NPR).<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.
