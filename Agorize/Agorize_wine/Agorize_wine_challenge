CATEGORY TWO: CONSUMER INFORMATION
####################

Nowadays, consumers are increasingly concerned about what they are consuming, preferring quality over quantity. Consumers want to know about nutritional information, the ingredients we used in different products, the alcohol content and how to consume them responsibly at anytime and anywhere. 

With the help of technology, it has never been easier and faster to access all kinds of information online. The question now is how can we help consumers have accurate information about their drinks, may it be the cocktail or the bottle they choose to consume?

Your challenge: How can we leverage digital trends and technologies to find innovative solutions to deliver key information about alcoholic beverages and how to consume them responsibly?

Keep in mind that your project will need to answer the following requirements:

Provide calories and other nutritional information
Inform consumers about the ingredients used in the products
Inform them about the alcohol content and encourage them to drink responsibly

--> Can have an app called Tappd
    You can search for the drink and it would give you the calorie info if you are a woman, man or transgendered
    Can provide ingrident information + sourcing + reviews
    - Can use AI to look at the drink and then it can give you the clore


Tappd
How it would work
You can search for a beverage and it would provide alcohol, nutritional and ingredient information
You can also search for when you combine differnet drinks and it would give you what the outocome would be 
It can also give you the best food pairing and how much would be needed before you get intoxicated
If more information is needed it can tell you were the drinks were sourced
It would also have an option to call a taxi, or ride hailing app (uber, lyft)
Could also use machine vision to look at drinks and it would tell you (future version)
