## Overview
Automation Anywhere makes it easy to remove mundane tasks from every employeeâ€™s life with Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA is helping businesses better serve their customers, improve operational efficiency, and empower employees to build the career of their dreams.

Be a part of the future of work. Bot Games is the RPA developer bot building contest that helps organizations go be great by building AI-powered, cloud-native, web-based intelligent automation. We invite developers from around the world to showcase bots to help employees return to a better, more creative workplace for a chance to win $5000 and other valuable prizes.

Automation 360 cloud is robust for professional programmers, yet easy enough for those new to automation. Build advanced automation using the built-in capabilities of Automation 360 along with your own custom code that you may write in Python, JavaScript, .NET, or Java. Built-in integration capabilities make it easy to leverage your own machine learning models, 3rd party AI services, or integration with REST/SOAP APIs. If you are new to RPA, cloud-based automation is designed for ease-of-use, with intuitive drag-and-drop actions and visual flow charts. Cloud RPA enables users to automate any process via a web-based interface accessed in their browser.
