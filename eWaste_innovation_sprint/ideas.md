Effective E-waste Management Regulatory Framework coupled with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

WHy
e-waste collection sites and dismantling plant. However,
there are still e-waste management issues particular in
some institutions and local areas. Due to population
escalation, beliefs and awareness of citizens and actual
e-waste situation that make regulations hard to enact are
the most important issues. Moreover, propelled by
development and other crucial government issues root
local governments not to be attentive to informal e-waste
processing and disposal. In these situations, the Rwanda
government should ensure that the EEE policies is
consistently implemented.

Solution
Focused on driving consistent implementation + using local information and stories

Rwanda has 
E-waste policy National Steering Committee on
E-waste recycling facility 

Detailed solution
Focus on trade & exchange + logistic chain

consumer facing mobile app for individuals and small businesses
The app would provide information on 
 - Myths about recycling
 - How it can be refurbrished
 - Alternative uses (Reduce, reuse)
 - Where it can be recycled
 - rewards program

business web app to keep track of the waste through the lifecycle of the process
 - WHo is recycling + keep track of the rewards program
 - Where it is going
 - How it was displosed off
 - Providing statistics for the government
 - State of the supply chain
 - recycling guidelines
 - Send information to business and consumers about latest updates and knowledge + backend (ML systems for trend analysis, customer segmentation, ) for customized messages
