## Graph For All Million Dollar Challenge
GRAPH FOR ALL MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE is a global search for innovative ways to harness the power of graph technology to solve real problems. Solutions will be judged across 4 prize categories: 

- The Most Impactful Solution
- The Most Innovative Use Case of Graph
- The Most Ambitious and Complex Graph
- The Most Applicable Graph Solution

We want to unlock peoples' passions and creativity for solving problems that matter most to them and to show the world through the diverse submissions that graph has vast use case potential and the power to find insights behind complex problems. Graph technology is already a “must-have” for healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and media. The possibilities are endless.

### WHAT TO SUBMIT
1) Demo video. Your video should be under 3 minutes, include a demo of how your solution works, and highlight your novel idea.

2) Code. Provide a URL and access to your GitHub code repository. Your repository should include all your relevant project code and a README with getting started instructions that allow others to test your project (here is an example). Provide access by making your code public or sharing access with devposttesting and TigerGraph-MDC GitHub accounts. 

3) Write-Up. Provide a written defense of your project, explaining its strength in each of the four judging criteria (see Judging and Criteria in the Rules). Provide supporting facts and statistics as appropriate. The response for each criterion may be up to 250 words. The four criteria are:
Impactfulness - for solving a real-world problem
Innovativeness - for use of Graph
Ambitiousness - for the scale and complexity of the Graph
Applicability - for adoption in the real world


### JUDGING CRITERIA
<b>Impactfulness</b>
The degree to which the graph solution betters people’s lives via positive impacts in one or more domains. This includes: Reach (number of people helped), Value (social/economic benefit), & Depth (addressing root issues)

Innovativeness
The degree to which the graph solution offers either a novel approach to the problem or a novel use of graph. This includes: Novelty (new way to frame complicated problems with graph) & Creativity (resourcefulness in overcoming challenges)

Ambitiousness
The degree to which the graph solution pushes the boundary of scale and scope of graph to solve real world problems. This includes: Schema scope (graph schema size), Scale (graph data size), & Functional scope (coverage of functional features)

Applicability
The degree to which the graph solution is ready to be adopted and applied with reasonable resources and investment. This includes: Adoption (ease of putting the solution into real-world use) & Breadth (number and size of industries that could adopt this)
