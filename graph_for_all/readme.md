## Graph For All Million Dollar Challenge
GRAPH FOR ALL MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE is a global search for innovative ways to harness the power of graph technology to solve real problems. Solutions will be judged across 4 prize categories: 

- The Most Impactful Solution
- The Most Innovative Use Case of Graph
- The Most Ambitious and Complex Graph
- The Most Applicable Graph Solution

We want to unlock peoples' passions and creativity for solving problems that matter most to them and to show the world through the diverse submissions that graph has vast use case potential and the power to find insights behind complex problems. Graph technology is already a “must-have” for healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and media. The possibilities are endless.

### WHAT TO SUBMIT
1) Demo video. Your video should be under 3 minutes, include a demo of how your solution works, and highlight your novel idea.

2) Code. Provide a URL and access to your GitHub code repository. Your repository should include all your relevant project code and a README with getting started instructions that allow others to test your project (here is an example). Provide access by making your code public or sharing access with devposttesting and TigerGraph-MDC GitHub accounts. (https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/graph-for-all-submission-template)

3) Write-Up. Provide a written defense of your project, explaining its strength in each of the four judging criteria (see Judging and Criteria in the Rules). Provide supporting facts and statistics as appropriate. The response for each criterion may be up to 250 words. The four criteria are:
Impactfulness - for solving a real-world problem
Innovativeness - for use of Graph
Ambitiousness - for the scale and complexity of the Graph
Applicability - for adoption in the real world


### JUDGING CRITERIA
<b>Impactfulness</b>
The degree to which the graph solution betters people’s lives via positive impacts in one or more domains. This includes: Reach (number of people helped), Value (social/economic benefit), & Depth (addressing root issues)

Innovativeness
The degree to which the graph solution offers either a novel approach to the problem or a novel use of graph. This includes: Novelty (new way to frame complicated problems with graph) & Creativity (resourcefulness in overcoming challenges)

Ambitiousness
The degree to which the graph solution pushes the boundary of scale and scope of graph to solve real world problems. This includes: Schema scope (graph schema size), Scale (graph data size), & Functional scope (coverage of functional features)

Applicability
The degree to which the graph solution is ready to be adopted and applied with reasonable resources and investment. This includes: Adoption (ease of putting the solution into real-world use) & Breadth (number and size of industries that could adopt this)

### Project Requirements

(i) What to Create: Entrants must use TigerGraph's graph analytics platform to uncover transformative solutions to a real world problem (each a “Project”). Entrants must select a problem statement from the provided list found here: [https://graphforall.devpost.com/details/inspiration] (each a “Problem Statement”).

(ii) Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

(iii) Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements.

(iv) New & Existing: Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant’s Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have been significantly updated after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period.

(v) Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them.

(vi) Testing: The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.  For Projects running on widely available smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, Entrants must make their Project available by providing a URL to the Project GitHub code repository for judging and testing. Entrants must:

Provide access to the Project by making it public or share access to devposttesting and TigerGraph-MDC GitHub accounts.
Include all your relevant Project code, and a README with getting started instructions that allow viewers to test your submission.
 

### Submission Requirements. 
Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and that meets the above Project Requirements.
Include a text description that explains the features and functionality of your Project.
Declare the Problem Statement of your Project.
Provide a written defense of your project, explaining its strength in each of the four judging criteria (see Judging and Criteria below). Provide supporting facts and statistics as appropriate. The response for each criterion may be up to 250 words. The four criteria are:
Impactfulness - for solving a real-world problem
Innovativeness - for use of Graph
Ambitiousness - for the scale and complexity of the Graph
Applicability - for adoption in the real world
Provide a URL and access to the Project GitHub code repository. The repository must include all relevant Project code and a README with getting started instructions that allow viewers to test the Project. Provide access by making the GitHub code repository public or sharing access with devposttesting and TigerGraph-MDC GitHub accounts.
Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the submission:
should be less than three (3) minutes
should include footage that explains how your solution works and highlights your Problem Statement.
should show the Project functioning on the device for which it was built
