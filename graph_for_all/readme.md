## Graph For All Million Dollar Challenge

GRAPH FOR ALL MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE is a global search for innovative ways to harness the power of graph technology to solve real problems. Solutions will be judged across 4 prize categories: 

- The Most Impactful Solution
- The Most Innovative Use Case of Graph
- The Most Ambitious and Complex Graph
- The Most Applicable Graph Solution

We want to unlock peoples' passions and creativity for solving problems that matter most to them and to show the world through the diverse submissions that graph has vast use case potential and the power to find insights behind complex problems. Graph technology is already a “must-have” for healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and media. The possibilities are endless.
