### Predict Global Crises
Domain Expert: Haris Dindo, Chief Technology Officer at SHS Asset Management

The Problem
Throughout history, we have seen how one country’s decisions and behaviors can affect others, if not the world. The most recent example is the crisis of 2007/08, when the US housing market collapsed and triggered the whole world to go into a crisis. Another - more recent - example is that of the insurgence of COVID-19 pandemic. Besides these, there are myriad other disruptive crises among world countries. Since history tends to repeat itself, one cannot help but wonder if one could minimize the effects of another country’s crisis on their own population.  

The Challenge
Given that all countries are connected to each other, construct a graph to see how much one country’s crisis will affect the other. Treat countries as nodes and their relationships as links. Leverage the different socio-economic and macroeconomic aspects that were captured for each country throughout time in order to predict a crisis, or, to predict what other countries will be affected by one country’s crisis. This would help countries minimize the effects of another country’s crisis on their own citizens.

### Create STEM Opportunities for Women
Author: McKenzie Steenson, Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Boise State University | Developer Advocate Intern at TigerGraph 

The Problem

“Women make up only 28% of the workforce in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and men vastly outnumber women majoring in most STEM fields in college. The gender gaps are particularly high in some of the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the future, like computer science and engineering.” (AAUW) 

Women in STEM face equal economic and educational challenges that may contribute to the low number of women continuing on in STEM fields after college, “38% of women who major in computers work in computer fields, and only 24% of those who majored in engineering work in the engineering field.” (Pew Research) Until the differences in these statistics can be closed, companies and communities must come together to support women to succeed in math and science. The American Association of University Women outlines four keys to closing the STEM Gap, yet dynamic and global solutions have yet to seem to exist. Giving women opportunities to advance their careers and connect to other strong women, especially in STEM careers, can help narrow the pay gap which will in turn enhance women’s economic security. It will also continue to develop a diverse and successful STEM workforce to prevent bias in products and services created, which benefits all. 

The Challenge
Here is a sample application, STEM Women, that highlights connecting women in STEM. The tool, a simple searchable database, was created to combat the lack of representation of women in STEM, but is only focused in Australia and not globally. Graph can be utilized to build a database of many people, places, and things and connect them all together by their relationships, and the power of graph technology can take those relationships global. For example, TigerGraph’s powerful machine learning applications for recommendation systems can drive women to the right job postings/openings, networking opportunities, diversity/inclusion events, mentorships, etc. to women in STEM and other related fields. The winning solution will utilize graph to help create more economic opportunities for women pursuing or currently in STEM careers using the power of graphs. Technology driven solutions in the technology driven field of STEM will continue the pursuit of closing the STEM gap, providing support and opportunity for all.
