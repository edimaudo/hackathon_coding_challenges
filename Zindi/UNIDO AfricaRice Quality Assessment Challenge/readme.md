## About
**Can your computer vision model assess rice quality for Ghanaian farmers?**

Across Africa, rice is a critical staple food - yet ensuring consistent quality remains a major challenge along the rice value chain. From farmers and aggregators to millers and traders, stakeholders need simple, reliable ways to assess rice quality and consistency using the tools they already have.

This challenge invites you to build a computer vision model that can assess rice quality directly from images. The goal is to enable a field-ready, mobile-friendly solution where a user can take a photo of a rice sample and instantly receive meaningful quality indicators to support real-time decision-making.

Given an image of rice grains captured under controlled conditions, your model will predict scientifically grounded and practically useful quality indicators for non-technical users across the rice value chain.

## Data
You will work with image datasets of rice samples provided in three processing states:

- Paddy rice
- Brown rice
- White rice

Each image is complemented by laboratory-measured reference data on quality generated by industry-standard rice analysis equipment. These measurements serve as the ground truth labels for training and evaluation.

**Target variables**:

Your model should extract key quality characteristics from images, focusing on:

**Grain Count, Structure & Size**
- Count
- Broken_Count
- Long_Count
- Medium_Count

**Grain Colour**
- Black_Count
- Chalky_Count
- Red_Count
- Yellow_Count
- Green_Count

**Average Whole Kernel Length to Width Ratio**
- WK_Length_Average
- WK_Width_Average
- WK_LW_Ratio_Average

**Colour Space Features (CIELAB)**
- Average_L
- Average_a
- Average_b

## Evaluation
This challenge uses multi-metric evaluation. Your results will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

For each image, you will submit predicted values for 15 target variables. To perform well in this challenge, your solution needs to be correct across all 15 variables.

## About [Africa Rice Center](https://www.africarice.org)

The Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) is a leading pan-African centre of excellence for rice research, development, and capacity-building. Its work contributes to reducing poverty, ensuring food and nutritional security, and improving the livelihoods of farmers and other actors in the rice value chain in Africa. It does this by increasing the productivity and profitability of rice-based agri-food systems, while ensuring the sustainability of natural resources.

AfricaRice’s highest governing body is the Council of Ministers. This unique governance gives AfricaRice unparalleled access to the highest levels of decision-making in African governments. AfricaRice has been given the mandate to support the continent in developing the rice sector through research, development, and partnership activities. AfricaRice is a CGIAR Research Center — part of a global research partnership for a food-secure future.
