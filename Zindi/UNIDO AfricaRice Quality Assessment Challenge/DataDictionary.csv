VARIABLE,DESCRIPTION
Count,Total number of rice grains detected in the image.
Broken_Count,Number of grains classified as broken (typically below a length threshold relative to whole grains).
Long_Count,Number of grains classified as long based on length criteria defined by the lab system.
Medium_Count,Number of grains classified as medium-length.
Black_Count,"Number of grains with black or dark discoloration, often associated with damage or spoilage."
Chalky_Count,"Number of grains exhibiting chalkiness (opaque or white areas), a common quality defect affecting milling yield. This is only for white rice samples."
Red_Count,"Number of grains with red pigmentation, often linked to varietal traits or incomplete milling."
Yellow_Count,"Number of grains showing yellow discoloration, potentially due to ageing, moisture, or processing issues."
Green_Count,Number of immature grains with green coloration.
WK_Length_Average,Average length of whole rice kernels (typically measured in millimetres).
WK_Width_Average,Average width of whole rice kernels.
WK_LW_Ratio_Average,"Average length-to-width ratio of whole kernels, commonly used to describe grain shape (e.g. slender vs bold)."
Average_L,"Average lightness value (L*), where higher values indicate brighter grains."
Average_a,"Average a* value, representing the red–green axis (positive = red, negative = green)."
Average_b,"Average b* value, representing the yellow–blue axis (positive = yellow, negative = blue)."
