## AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast Challenge
***

## Business Overview
Until recently there has been a lack of data on air quality across sub-Saharan Africa. Reference grade monitors are extremely expensive and without access to data it is very difficult to raise awareness of the issues, or for government, business and individuals to know which actions to take to improve air quality and protect community health.

AirQo has built a low-cost network of sensors and collected data across 65 locations in Uganda with some sites monitoring for over three years. There is now a wealth of data which can be used to achieve impact in this critical area. Birmingham University’s ASAP project makes use of this and similar data to gain insights into the relationship between urbanisation and air quality.

The increase in availability of air quality data allows us to analyse historical and up to the minute results to gain insights into trends, hotspots, causes and consequences of poor air, potential policy solutions and so much more.

The ability to accurately predict what air quality will be in the coming days is also essential for empowering everyone from governments to families to make informed decisions to protect health and guide action, just as we do with weather.

Activities that are known to contribute to poor air quality such as high traffic volumes, rubbish burning, cooking using charcoal and firewood, even construction or other government works can also be reconsidered depending on the forecast.

If it is known that the next day will be a high pollution day then sports or other events may need to be rescheduled or relocated. Sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, sick or those with respiratory illnesses may need to remain inside. Schools can plan the timing of outdoor activities such as field trips or sports events with confidence.

We are hopeful that these forecasts will be used to inform public awareness and be built into safety alerts. They can become part of daily news coverage whether in traditional or social media in the same way weather is currently presented. The solution could literally be life saving.

The objective of this challenge is to accurately forecast air quality (as measured by PM2.5 µ/m3) for each hour of the coming 25 hours across five locations in Kampala Uganda. Forecasts will be based on the past 5 days of hourly air quality measurements at each site.

AirQo is a research initiative of the College of Computing and Information Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. For over three years it has been developing monitoring devices suitable for the local context to address the lack of air quality monitoring in the country. In 2019 AirQo received a grant from Google.org which enabled them to increase the scale of the network, adopt a cloud based platform for community network management and make use of machine learning to make best use of the data including calibration, device placement, making spatial and temporal forecasts and more


[ASAP] (asap.uk.com)

ASAP (A Systems Approach to Air Pollution) is a research project led the University of Birmingham, UK with multiple international partners focusing on urbanisation and air quality in east Africa, with a focus on Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to studying the causes and consequences of air pollution in the region as it develops. They also explore the governance, awareness raising and policy issues involved in finding solutions to this challenge

## Data Overview

One of the main indicators of air quality is PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter or around 1/30th the thickness of a human hair). These particles can be generated by traffic exhaust, industry, burning of fossil fuels and many other sources. The particles are so small that they are invisible to the naked eye and when inhaled do not just collect in the lungs and cause respiratory disease but can also enter the bloodstream and contribute to heart disease and stroke. The critical measure is the mass of PM2.5 particles in a volume of air, given by micrograms per cubic meter (µ/m3).

Guidelines on hazardous levels of PM2.5 are given below

This data has been collected from five sensors stationed across Uganda. Readings are taken every hour. As is the reality with all data there are missing values. This is a challenge for you to overcome.

Your solution needs to be generalizable and be able to applied to all test periods without changing the solution parameters.

The objective of this challenge is to predict the air quality level at exactly 24 hours after a 5-day series of hourly weather data readings which include temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity.

For example, you may be given weather indicators (but no air quality data) from 3:00 am on 9 March to 3:00 am on 14 March. Based on these weather indicators, you will need to predict the air quality reading at exactly 3:00 am on 15 March (24 hours after the last weather data reading). Note that you are not given the date or time for any of the data.

The weather indicators available in the train and test are:

temp: mean temperature recorded at the site over the hour (degrees Celsius)*
precip: total rainfall in mm recorded at the site over the hour (mm)*
wind_dir: mean direction of the wind over the hour (degrees)*
wind_spd: mean wind speed at the site over the hour (metres per second)*
atmos_press: mean atmospheric pressure(atm)*
Each series of weather and air quality readings will be associated with a unique sensor. You will have a set of features on each of the five sensor:

Location: one of either A,B,C, D or E referring to the five different locations selected

loc_altitude: The height above sea level at the location in metres

Km2: the area of the parish in which the device is located in square km

Aspect: the direction the slope on which the device is located faces

Dist_motorway: distance of the device from the nearest motorway in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_trunk: distance of the device from the nearest trunk road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_primary: distance of the device from the nearest primary road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_secondary: distance of the device from the nearest secondary road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_tertiary: distance of the device from the nearest tertiary road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_unclassified: distance of the device from the nearest unclassified road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Dist_residential: distance of the device from the nearest residential road in metres (values greater than 5000m are NaN)✝✝

Popn: The population of the parish in which the device is located✝

The target variable is pm2_5, i.e. mean mass of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres per cubic metre of air (µ/m3), as read exactly 24 hours after the last weather indicators’ reading.

The training data consists of 15,000 sets of 5 days of hourly weather data readings plus one air quality reading exactly 24 hours after the last weather reading. The test set consists of a different 5,000 sets of 5-day hourly weather data readings.
