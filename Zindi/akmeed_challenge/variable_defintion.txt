'location_number': Location number (most customers have one or two)
'location_type': Home, Work, Other or NA
'Latitude' and 'longitude': Not true latitude and longitude - locations have been masked, but nearby locations remain nearby in the new reference frame and can thus be used for clustering. However, not all locations are useful due to GPS errors and missing data - you may want to treat outliers separately.
