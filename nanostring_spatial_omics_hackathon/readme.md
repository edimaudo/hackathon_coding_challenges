###Project Requirements

(i) What to Create: Entrants must create a working open source software application that can help scientists interpret data and learn new things from a large kidney dataset assembled by NanoString’s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (each a “Project”). 

(ii) Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

(iii) Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements. 

(iv) New: Projects must be newly created by the Entrant during the Submission Period.

(v) Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them.

(vi) Testing: The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Entrants must make their Projects available for testing by:

Providing a link to the publicly available code repository hosting the application’s code, and any other deployment files and instructions needed. Entrants must ensure code compiles fine and works as expected before sharing.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.  

vii. Public Distribution: The Entrant must make the application open source under one of the non-copyleft OSI-approved open source licenses (https://opensource.org/licenses), such as Apache, BSD, or MIT, and include the license in the publicly accessible code repository. 

### Submission Requirements

- Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.

- Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your Project.

- Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the submission: should be less than three (3) minutes
  should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built
  must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and
  must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.

- Include a URL to the publicly available code repository.

- Include a non-copyleft OSI-approved open source license in the publicly available code repository. 

- Be the original work of the submitter, be solely owned by the submitter, and not violate the IP rights of any other person or entity.

- Multiple Submissions: An Entrant may submit more than one Submission, however, each submission must be unique and substantially different from each of the Entrant’s other Submissions, as determined by the Sponsor and Devpost in their sole discretion.
