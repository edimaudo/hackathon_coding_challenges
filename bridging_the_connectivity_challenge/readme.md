# Bridging the connectivity challenge

## About the Hackathon:
***
By 2021, Canada’s federal government has committed to bringing high-speed internet to 90% of Canadians. However, we still have a long ways to go. Many rural communities are still working on bridging that digital divide.  Cybera and ISAIC are teaming up to host a virtual open data science hackathon from May 3-30, 2021. This event will give participants (individuals or self-formed teams) the opportunity to connect with others from across the province who are interested in data science. Extract insights from open data sets, and leverage virtual machines and professional development workshops to develop a solution that will enrich our province.

##Goal
***
1) Use relevant and open data to assess the connectivity barriers and gaps that exist throughout Alberta. This includes identifying communities that are under-served.

2) Assess the correlation between social and economic indicators, and the speed of connectivity, to determine the role high-speed internet plays in community growth and sustainability.

##Outcome
***
Develop a data product that:
- Have a clear goal or hypothesis that aligns with the hackathon’s goals
- Identify, use, and transform relevant open datasets
- Analyze data and offer compelling metrics and data visualizations that support the participant's hypothesis
- Tells a story

## Judging Criteria
***
- Social Impact = 25%
- Creativity & Resourcefulness = 25%
- Communicating Your Project Story = 25%
- Technical Proficiency, Implementation and Feasibility = 25%
