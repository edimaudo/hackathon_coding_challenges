My problem
##############
Even as women are increasingly taking on a larger role in the paid workforce, they’re still expected to take on the bulk of chores, like laundry, cooking, cleaning and child care that allow households to function.  Whether by choice or not, men still end up doing more paid work. “Women, even full-time working women, spend fewer hours on average doing paid work than their husbands or partners do. That may be due in part to the fact that there’s this expectation or default arrangement where they are doing more of the child care or housework.  COVID-19 has transformed home life — turning kitchen tables into home offices and classrooms and putting a spotlight on the countless household tasks typically performed by women.  
Currently men are good at one of big projects such as car maintenance.  Women mostly do day to day household operations.

My solution
##############
An platform that would help families split the work more equitably.  The goal is to fix labor inequality and emotional mental load often done predominately by women.  Furthermore, it would be strong resilience in the family since not all partners are overburdened.  Core demographic are heterosexual couples. It would achieve this by utilizing experiments and house systems to plan, split up the work, receive feedback and ensure things are running smoothly.
