### Application
The application analyzes printer companion app reviews scraped from the Google Play store.  It looks at 4 companion apps: Epson SmartPanel, Epson iPrint, HP Smart and Canon Print.  It is built using streamlit.
The analysis focuses on generating visualization based on the data and performing text analysis which focuses on **Emotional traits & Sentiment analysis**. The text analysis uses the expertAI Natural Language API: Document analysis (keyphrase extraction, Named entity recognition, sentiment analysis) and Document classification (emotional traits, behavorial traits).
