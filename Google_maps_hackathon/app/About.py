    The Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF) is an agency of the Government of Ontario, and one of Canada's largest granting foundations. 
    Every year, more than 3000 applications are received, and over 
    \$ 136 million in grants are awarded to more than 1,000 community organizations. 
    This means OTF will invest more than $1 billion in Ontarioâ€™s public benefit sector over the next decade, 
    creating significant opportunities for positive community change.
