# Theme: Birds
 
May marks the heart of bird migration season in many parts of the world, especially across the Northern Hemisphere. As temperatures rise and ecosystems bloom, millions of birds travel vast distances between continents, transforming skies and soundscapes as they go. Itâ€™s a time when people all over the world look up in wonder (and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to do the same with our data!).
 
Birds also give us a fascinating lens into biodiversity, climate, habitat change, and even culture.
