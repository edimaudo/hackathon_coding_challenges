Story 1: "The May Symphony - Tracking Bird Songs Through the Morning"
Story Angle:
This story explores the dynamic patterns of bird vocalizations throughout the morning hours in May, showing how different species create a coordinated "symphony" at different times.
Visualizations:

Bird Activity Timeline Dashboard:

Interactive timeline showing which birds are singing during each minute of observation
Color-coded by species or family
Height of bars indicating detection frequency
Ability to filter by detection type (songs vs. calls)


Species Vocal Pattern Analysis:

Heat map of bird activity by minute (Minutes 1-10) across species
Visualization highlighting which species sing continuously vs. intermittently
Special focus on the Wood Thrush, which shows consistent activity throughout all minutes


Early vs. Late Morning Chorus Comparison:

Split visualization comparing 6:38 AM data vs. 9:15 AM data
Species richness metrics for each time period
Bird family composition pie charts for each time period



Narrative Elements:
Explore how May represents peak vocal activity as breeding season coincides with migration, discussing how birds use song to establish territories and attract mates during this crucial period. The visualization could highlight how morning chorus patterns provide insights into species behavior and ecosystem health.
Story 2: "Proximity Patterns - Detecting Birds Across Distances"
Story Angle:
This story examines how birds position themselves in the landscape and how detection patterns vary across different distance bands, revealing information about habitat preferences and behavior.
Visualizations:

Distance Band Distribution Dashboard:

Stacked bar chart showing proportion of detections across distance bands (≤ 50m, 51-75m, >75m)
Treemap of species grouped by detection distance
Ability to filter by species, family, or detection type


Species-Specific Range Analysis:

Scatter plot positioning each species based on typical detection distance
Circle size indicating frequency of detection
Color-coded by taxonomic family


Song vs. Call Detection Patterns:

Parallel comparison of detection types across distance bands
Analysis of which communication methods carry further in the environment
Connection to habitat structure and environmental factors



Narrative Elements:
Discuss how May's vegetation growth affects sound transmission through the environment and how different bird species have adapted their songs and calls to be heard at varying distances. Explore concepts of sound ecology and how birds partition acoustic space during peak migration and breeding season.
Story 3: "Avian Diversity In Eastern Riparian Habitats - A May Snapshot"
Story Angle:
This story showcases the rich biodiversity of bird species found in streamside habitats during May in eastern U.S. national parks, focusing on taxonomic relationships and ecological roles.
