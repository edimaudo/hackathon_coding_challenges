# Hack4NF

Do you have a passion for Genomic Data and want to make an impact in a rare disease? Hack with us for Neurofibromatosis (NF), a rare disease that affects 1 in 3,000 people globally each year. Ideate and develop viable solutions to help create awareness and medical advancements surrounding NF and other rare genetic disorders at Hack4NF 2022. 

Gather your team and get ready to compete 1 of 4 provided challenges for a variety of cash prizes with a total value of $25,000 in. Utilize datasets, engage with patients, and receive mentorship from experts in the field. Join us and patients all over the world in the hack to end NF.

Interested in attending an in person kickoff event? Join us in NYC or Seattle on October 15, 2022 at 1:00pm ET to celebrate the beginning of Hack4NF! Get the chance to learn more about the challenges, meet mentors, and start forming teams.

## The Challenges
**Challenge #1**

GENIE-NF tumor identification and classification challenge

Question:

Use the provided Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) datasets provided to develop a new framework that accurately uses genomic data to classify tumor samples for neurofibromatosis-related tumors. First, identify the neurofibromatosis-related tumors in the dataset - this could be defined as all tumors with mutations in NF-relevant genes, or tumors that are common in patients with NF, or another rational definition. Then, use one or more classification methods to classify the tumor samples into different groups based on genetic features. 

Dataset(s):

Early access to version 13 of the GENIE dataset for hackathon registrants. You are encouraged to also use other external datasets, but you must include the GENIE dataset in your project.  

Example Solutions:

A classification algorithm that differentiates different types of NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis-related tumors using clinical sequencing data. A list of the most important features in your algorithm for differentiating tumor types.  



**Challenge #2**

Devising in silico strategies to prioritize likely pathogenic NF1 germline variants

Question:

Given a germline variant dataset from neurofibromatosis type 1, develop a strategy to score the pathogenicity of individual NF1 variants. Your solution may combine features of the variant, predictions and findings from external data sources, AlphaFold protein structure predictions, literature-mining, or other evidence sources to assign a severity score to any NF1 variant. We recommend that participants read this recent preprint focused on how to rigorously test missense prediction algorithms.

Dataset(s):

We will provide a list of germline NF1 variants from the Leiden Open Variation Database. Any external methods or databases you might want to leverage (e.g. PolyPhen, SIFT, COSMIC, LOVD, etc).

Example Solutions:

Apply your computational algorithm to rank the variants from the provided list from most severe to least severe impact. Please provide a description of your algorithm and a code repository containing all relevant code.



**Challenge #3**

In silico drug target screening for NF

Question:

Use variant, gene expression, or drug screening data from different sources and apply already-published or new methods to predict drug targets that could be helpful in treating manifestations of NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis. We recommend running your algorithm on this test set of variants (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/NF1/unique) and to present the results fro your algorithm.

Dataset(s):

Publicly accessible drug screen data on tumors, processed variant or gene expression data from different sources (e.g. NF Data Portal, cBioPortal, GENIE, Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas), any other datasets that you can find.

Example Solutions:

All teams must produce a ranked list of drugs for NF1-related tumors, NF2-related tumors, and/or schwannomatosis-related tumors. Organizers will aggregate the ranked lists and will publish this list openly (e.g., F1000) for the NF research community to mine.



**Wildcard Challenge**

Have an idea that uses one of these datasets? Go for it! However, ideas must be pre approved by the organizing committee. Submit your idea by October 21, 2022 to be eligible for a Wild Card project.
