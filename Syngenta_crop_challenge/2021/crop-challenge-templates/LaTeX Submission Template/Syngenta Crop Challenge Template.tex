\ABSTRACT{%
You should replace this paragraph with your abstract. Following the standards of academic publications, this report should provide the criteria used in determining stress metrics, a clear description of the methodology and theory used, the quantitative results that justify the selection, and appropriate references. In the abstract, please briefly summarize your stress metrics and key points.

\section{Introduction}

In the introduction, you should include an overview of the approach. Throughout the document include citations as appropriate. As an example, include citations of the form: (Syngenta, 2020 or Syngenta (2020). Included figures and tables should be labeled and captioned with a short description.


\section{Methodology and Theory}

Present the methodology and theory of your approach. Charts, diagrams or other
visualizations constructed from analyzing data may be useful to communicate your thoughts
and possible approaches. Subsections are allowed. 


\section{Quantitative Results}

In accordance with your methodology, present results that justify your stress metrics and classifications of hybrids. Subsections are allowed.

\section{Conclusion}

Provide a summary of key findings.

\section{Team Members}

List all team members associated with the submission, including the corresponding author. A teamâ€™s solution should be submitted once (as opposed to each member of the team submitting the same solution individually).
