Suggested Social Hack Categories
1. Health Care
With the global population living longer and many people living with noncommunicable diseases (422 million with diabetes) that require regular medical check-ins, the healthcare burden and ease of accessibility is shifting.

The pandemic has shown there is an urgent need for infrastructure to cope with the health care crisis that addresses secure, reliable and timely data (Contact, last-check up, medical history, etc)

Example Applications to Build:

Volunteer report Covid Status with location history
Quarantine Tracker
Cost of Medicine Reporter
2. Diversity in Tech
Inclusion, Equity, Justice, and Diversity aren't just buzz words, they are crucial aspects of team-building. People of different races, ethnicities, gender identities, backgrounds, sexual orientations, ages, and other differentiating factors all bring unique perspectives to the table.

Having a diverse workforce not only allows companies to understand the unique needs of their global customer bases but improves the performance of their teams.

Example Applications to Build:

Computer recycling program
Accessibility widget
Learn how to code as a Family (Parents vs Children)
3. Wage Gap
A range of Inequity - The gender pay gap is the result of many factors, including race and ethnicity, disability, social norms, access to education, culture, and age.

As a result, different groups of women and gender non-conforming individuals experience very different compensations. The gender pay gap is a complex issue that requires robust and inclusive solutions.

Example Applications to Build:

Wage Reporter
Worth Calculator (hard skills and experience)
Negotiation practice
4. Climate
There are many factors that influence the climate and it can be difficult to know how good (or bad) the decisions you are making are. Did you know that the average American is responsible for 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year from electricity usage, transportation, heating, food, and other sources? Emissions from electricity and food change geographically and seasonally.

Design an app that helps users track carbon emissions based on location and data inputs.

Example Applications to Build:

Carbon footprint tracking app
An application that rates companies based on their carbon footprint
Applications that shows how many trees would need to be planted to offset a decision
5. Open to Any Social Cause
You do not have to pick from the suggested list above. You may pick any social cause that you care about!
