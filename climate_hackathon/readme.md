## Overview
WELCOME TO OUR CLIMATE HACKATHON DEDICATED TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.
This hackathon is about you. It's about me. It's about us and the Earth. It's a hackathon about respect for the environment and to stand united for the climate, through our way of living. This is about sustainability. Nothing else can be more important.

Developers of all background and skills are welcome to participate, and weâ€™re looking forward to your innovative contributions for an even more sustainable world.

The environmental challenges are many, each with its own complexity. In some areas we have come a long way, in other areas the humanity has barely moved.


## WHAT TO BUILD:
A software solution (completed or a prototype) using one or more technologies from Microsoft (including but not limited to Azure cloud, Power Platform, Microsoft 365) that solves one of the following challenges:

## Challenge #1 by HUB Ocean and Cognite:
As a participating team, we want you to develop a solution that make it easier to gain insight into current global, regional or local traffic patterns for ships, how greenhouse gas emissions are trending and how particularly vulnerable areas and marine life are affected

## Challenge #2 by Inditex:
As a participating team, we want you to develop a solution of measuring and/ or calculating precise energy and water consumption figures of the facilities (and different processes carried out in each of them) involved in the manufacturing of garments, considering not only the potential installation/deployment costs, but also any maintenance fee related to any other stage.

Data accuracy and reliability of the information are essential, not only ensuring that the figures are obtained in a timely manner but also that they are coherent and validated so they can be used as a reference to carry out different initiatives.

## challenge #3 by DNB

## What to Submit:
- You have to submit 3 minutes long video about your solution.

What information does the pitch need to contain:
 - What is the Challenge
 - What is the Solution
 - What is the Vision
 - Your Team
