## WHAT TO BUILD:
A software solution (completed or a prototype) using one or more technologies from Microsoft (including but not limited to Azure cloud, Power Platform, Microsoft 365) that solves one of the following challenges:

## Challenge #1 by HUB Ocean and Cognite:
As a participating team, we want you to develop a solution that make it easier to gain insight into current global, regional or local traffic patterns for ships, how greenhouse gas emissions are trending and how particularly vulnerable areas and marine life are affected

## Challenge #2 by Inditex:
As a participating team, we want you to develop a solution of measuring and/ or calculating precise energy and water consumption figures of the facilities (and different processes carried out in each of them) involved in the manufacturing of garments, considering not only the potential installation/deployment costs, but also any maintenance fee related to any other stage.

Data accuracy and reliability of the information are essential, not only ensuring that the figures are obtained in a timely manner but also that they are coherent and validated so they can be used as a reference to carry out different initiatives.

## challenge #3 by DNB

## What to Submit:
- You have to submit 3 minutes long video about your solution.
