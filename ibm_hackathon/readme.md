## IBM Explainability Hackathon

### What is IBM Explainability Hackathon?
The IBM AI Explainability Masterclass and Hackathon is for all data scientists, AI developers, ML engineers, and curious computer science students looking to take their skills further and add explainability to their data models. 

Explainability is the ability for data scientists to produce applicable results for their peers, managers, and end users. Can your results be understood and applied by other data scientists and stakeholders? It is up to you as a data scientist to use your business knowledge, mathematical, and programmatic skills to communicate your findings and methods. Explainability is an important tool used to make your reasoning behind each decision transparent and repeatable.

### Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.Kaggle.com)

### Business Challenge
The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate).
