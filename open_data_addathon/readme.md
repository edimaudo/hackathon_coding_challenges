## Open Data ADDATHON
Abu Dhabi Digital Authority has compiled an open-source database where you can find everything you’d ever want to know about the city: the number of cars, percentage of rainfall, amount of reptiles in the zoo, and much more! 

The challenge is simple: using this database, create #DigitalSolutions to help improve the city’s infrastructure. Any useful output is accepted; be it a program, an application, a dashboard, or even a document. 


## Who should join?
Startups, businesses, data scientists, developers, and smart-city pioneers.
