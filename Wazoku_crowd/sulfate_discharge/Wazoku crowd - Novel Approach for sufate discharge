# Novel Approaches for Sulfate Removal from Water Discharges

## Overview

U.S. Steel, is seeking novel, effective, and scalable solutions for sulfate removal from water discharges at its Keetac plant in Minnesota, United States.
Reducing sulfate concentration at Keetac’s water discharge outfalls is required in order to comply with strict permit conditions. 
It is open to any method or approach, considering the solution requirements, including but not limited to: biological, chemical, mechanical, process innovations, and more.
The ideal solution would reduce the sulfate concentration in the discharges, resulting in compliance while also minimizing capital/operating costs and secondary environmental impacts.

## Background
The ”Iron Range” is a particularly iron-rich area around Lake Superior, in  northeastern Minnesota. U.S. Steel facility, Minnesota Ore Operations-Keetac, is located in Keewatin, Minnesota.
This facility is able to produce either direct-reduced (DR) iron ore pellets or blast furnace iron ore pellets, dependent on demand, which are both key components of the process to make steel.
As part of the production of these pellets and the ongoing processes of the plant, sulfates are produced that are then present in the water discharged by the facility. Sulfur can originate from the ore itself, and sulfate is naturally occurring in the groundwater and surface water surrounding the facility. The Keetac facility has 4 water discharge outfalls, dispersed around the site.
Each outfall contains different concentrations of sulfate, ranging from 20 to 200 milligrams per liter (mg/L) . In addition to the sulfate concentration ranges, each outfall flow volume can vary greatly depending on plant/mine activity and precipitation.

Outfall Name | Outfall Location | Outfall Purpose/Operations | Flow Volume in million gallons per day (MGD) | Sulfate Concentration Range (mg/L)

 - SD002 | Welcome Creek | This outfall is by the main plant, and discharges include surface water runoff from around the facility – not water used in any part of the operation. | 0.2 – 5.7 | 98 - 202

- SD003 | Mesabi Chief | Mine pit dewatering – this outfall removes groundwater and surface water runoff to keep the pit dry and enable mining. | 0.9 – 5.4 | 49 – 84

- SD005 | Tailings Basin | Includes water decanted from the fine tails and process water from the plant, including water from the wet scrubbers which is partially treated. | 5.76 – 82.1 | 85 - 133

- SD012 | Perry Pit | Mine pit dewatering – this outfall removes groundwater and surface water runoff to keep the pit dry to enable mining. Located at the west end of the facility. | 0.2-0.6 | 19 - 28


SD001, marked on the above Water Flow Diagram, is an internal outfall and therefore out of the scope of this Challenge. Please focus on solving for SD002, SD003, SD005, and SD012’s sulfate concentrations.

For reference, the outfall with the largest range of discharge flow volume is SD005, which has a long-term average flow of 9.6 MGD but is highly affected by precipitation events. Plant recycle water (for use in operations) is taken right before SD005 discharge and, depending on demand, there are times when the SD005 discharge is zero (0) MGD.

There are strict National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations regarding the allowed concentration of sulfates in outfall water. Each outfall must continuously meet concentrations of 14 mg/L monthly average, and a 24 mg/L daily maximum. The facility may be subject to enforcement if noncompliant with the NPDES permit limits.

To-date, no technology, approach, treatment or mitigating method is currently installed in the facility or at any of the outfalls to reduce the sulfate concentrations.

Solvers are welcome to suggest biological, chemical, mechanical, or other innovative solutions that can address the sulfate levels in water discharged by U.S. Steel Keetac. The solution or method can be a combination of innovations or technologies.

The solution or method may be used at any one or multiple of the four outfalls. The solution may be applied at a single point in the process to affect all outfalls or the outfalls could be potentially combined to be affected by one solution. U.S. Steel is open to manipulating the outfalls to achieve a solution.

Solvers are encouraged to be creative in their approaches to meet the requirements, while also balancing the need for swift and effective solutions that can address U.S. Steel’s Challenge.

While there is no listed cost limit for solutions to meet at this stage, Solvers are encouraged to be conscious and communicative about potential set-up, operational, and maintenance costs in their solutions.

## SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

U.S. Steel is primarily interested in solutions with the potential to meet the following requirements:
 

### Must have:

1. Effectively reduce sulfate concentrations at Keetac outfalls – continuously achieve average monthly concentration of 14 mg/L and a daily maximum concentration of 24 mg/L per NPDES permits.

This capability to reduce sulfate concentrations in discharge water from the facility must be continuous, not event-based.

2. Ability to operate in cold temperatures – with lows of −60 °F or −51.1 °C recorded in Minnesota winters in extreme cases.

Please note in your submission any potential area of your solution that may be negatively impacted by cold temperatures.

3. Minimized capital and operating costs of solution – U.S. Steel is looking for innovative approaches that can achieve the desired outcome while balancing operational and set-up costs. Please detail all costs in your submission.

4. Maintain networked effectiveness of the plant – in addressing the sulfate concentration Challenge, Solvers are encouraged to consider the wider operation of the plant and how to maintain, as far as possible, the ordinary operations involved in iron ore pellet production.

5. Must not cause future legacy sulfate mass issues (e.g. those proposing treatment and disposal of the mass must also consider where this could be disposed of effectively) or reduction in operation capacity or frequency of the plant (other than quick initial set-up).

### Nice to Have:
1. Limited increase in power consumption – it is desirable and encouraged that your solution does not dramatically increase the Keetac facility’s energy usage.

2. Limited number of treatment facilities – if your submission includes the use of sulfate treatment facilities, it would be desirable to limit the number (at least initially).

3. Minimized secondary environmental impacts – it is strongly encouraged that you detail any potential secondary environmental impacts or considerations involved in the installation or ongoing use of your solution.

## Submission Requirements
1. Participation type – you will first be asked to inform us how you are participating in this challenge, as a Solver (Individual) or Solver (Organization).

2. Solution Level - the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your solution.
3. Problem & Opportunity - highlight the innovation in your approach to the Problem, its point of difference, and the specific advantages/benefits this brings (up to 500 words).
4. Solution Overview - detail the features of your solution and how they address the SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS (500 words, there is space to add more in the summary field, and attach supporting data, diagrams, etc).
5. Experience - Expertise, use cases and skills you or your organization have in relation to your proposed solution.  (up to 500 words).
6. Solution Risks - any risks you see with your solution and how you would plan for this (up to 500 words).
