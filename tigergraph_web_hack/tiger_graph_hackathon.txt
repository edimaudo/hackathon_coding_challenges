==========
Timeline
==========
Hackathon Submission Period: Feb 22, 2020 (09:00am Eastern Time) – March 22, 2020 (11:45pm Eastern Time) (the “Hackathon Submission Period”)

==========
Application Requirements
==========
- Develop (or update) a solution that integrates with the TigerGraph database and enables or empowers the community.
  - Makers must develop (or update) a solution using https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/  blob/master/docs/TG2020_Graphathon.md that integrates with the TigerGraph database and Enables or Empowers the community.
  - The Application must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the TigerGraph Database platform for which it is intended, and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.
  - Text Description: The text description should explain the features and functionality of your Application.
  - Images: The image(s) should be photographs or screenshots of your working Application. 
  - Video: The required video portion of the Submission: 
    - should be less than three (3) minutes;
    - must include footage that clearly explains the Application’s features and  functionality through a comprehensive demo of the software; 
    - must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website;

- Share the link to the public code repository.  Make sure it is well documented (readme + comments + video) and looks great (UX + UI + error handling)

- Complete and enter all of the required fields on the “Enter a Submission” page of the Hackathon Website (each a “Submission”) during the Hackathon Submission Period, and follow the requirements below.

Submission requirements
==========
Criteria: The Judges will score eligible Submissions using the following criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

(i) Value Add 50%  (Value add can be measured by the number of components used, such as Plotly and graph visualizations, multi-pages, and custom unique components that might not already be built.); and

(ii) Completeness 25% (The submission is a built-out end-to-end solution, it’s well documented, and includes README instructions. The submission includes all aspects that are required for a qualified submission.); and

(iii) Robustness 25% (The submission is well designed with the following coding conventions and all code is fully functional and repeatable to relaunch the solution.)

============
Areas of focus
============
network and it resource optimization
cyber security threat it
healthcare referral

============
Objective
=============
The goal is to use the network and IT resource starter kit to understand how network and IT resources are being utilized.
From there a recommendation engine will be built to create the most optimized network process.

============
Business problem
=============

“One of Visa’s problems is they have a large infrastructure of servers, computer servers, storage areas, and they use virtualization a lot, like every data center operator out there. Virtualization is great, because it allows you to share resources, but it also creates interesting dependencies.”

If a particular network node goes down, one particular server goes down, one particular storage area goes down – what is the impact of that on the workload running on the affected component of network or IT infrastructure? Is it something that’s processing live payments coming in from the United States, from Europe, from Asia? Or is it something that’s simply handling a routine reporting workload that can easily be offloaded to a different server?

“So that impact analysis of something going down is what they manage in real-time with TigerGraph, and it’s a real-time Internet of Things use case, because you have IoT sensors attached to different computer servers, different storage arrays, which  are used to track the health of each component and inform when it goes down. With TigerGraph, Visa can understand the impact of a component going down and devise next steps to minimize the disruption.”

Overview
=============
With digital transformation, companies have more and more applications at their disposal that support business activities. Organizations, in turn, also face multiple problems: software is increasingly complex, solutions are quickly obsolete and development team turnover is significant. These situations naturally raise issues around knowledge transfer and maintenance of installed systems.
As the complexity of your network and IT infrastructure grows, you need a more powerful configuration management database than a relational database can provide. The graph database allows you to connect your network, data center, and IT assets in order to get important insights into the relationships between different operations within your network. For example, 
- understand the network to see how the business can help you manage dependencies and monitor microservices.
- gain critical insights into the complex relationships between different network or data center operations.
- correlate your network, data center and IT assets to help with troubleshooting
- impact analysis 
- capacity or outage planning
- Network and database infrastructure monitoring


=============
Approach
=============
1st section - exploratory analysis using plotly and pandas - Data Visualization

Will cover
Service
App
Server
Business Unit

Other data combination
What are the peak workloads and resource usage patterns by business unit

Impact analysis
E.g. What team's production servers are over provisioned and how big is the impact
appImpact
WarningImpact
StorageImpact

App Analysis
What is the peak workload for an application and where is the bottleneck

2nd Section - System interaction
How do the different systems and people interact and what are their patterns


3rd section - Recommendation
What is the recommendation action based on server status by team
IT staffing and resource consumption + looking at cost
