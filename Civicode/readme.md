## The Civicode
#codeForGood - design, develop, and demo solutions that impact health, education, environment, and empowerment.

### ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
#codeForGood - Our title sponsor is Microsoft! We encourage you to design, develop, and demo solutions that impact health, education, environment, and empowerment.

Whether it's a semester project or a minimum viable product that you submitted to one of our sponsored hackathons, we want you to extend your progress and see how far you can take it!

### REQUIREMENTS
**WHAT TO BUILD**
We want you to #codeForGood by building anything that helps people! Our four themes are:

- Health
- Education
- Environment
- Empowerment
You're welcome to build projects that combine themes as long as you clarify your primary theme and your secondary themes. If you're not sure which theme fits best, feel free to classify your project under Empowerment since that can operate as a catch-all term. For example, if you built a project addressing safety and security, we would usually consider that to be empowering others.

Everyone is eligible! However, each submission may only list six team members.

### WHAT TO SUBMIT
Pitch your project in a video. We recommend 2-4 minutes, but you're welcome to use any length you feel is best. You may also submit other supporting materials, including your code, GitHub repositories, and PDFs of your research. However, remember that sending too much information may obscure the best qualities of your product!
