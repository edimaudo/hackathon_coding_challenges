# Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative Global Hackathon

Use the power of the cloud and ASDI data to help the world become sustainable.

Explore Amazon’s Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) and the AWS Data Exchange to come up with solutions that contribute toward one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. 

The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets. ASDI provides access to petabytes of sustainability data hosted on AWS and available to anyone at no-cost. The ASDI catalog currently contains over 130 datasets organized into 14 categories including weather observations and forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. ASDI is now integrated with AWS Data Exchange giving customers streamlined access across third-party data sources, so you can search the ASDI catalog alongside custom or licensed datasets. Customers can now search and obtain the data assets needed to support sustainability solutions, all in one location.

## WHAT TO BUILD
We invite you to use your creativity, intelligence and technical chops to build sustainability solutions utilizing data from ASDI and AWS Data Exchange on SageMaker Studio Lab or any AWS cloud services to solve one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
