Overview
proud to host our virtual ‘IDEAthon’ from March 5-7, 2021 and we are seeking people like you to help us imagine novel and exciting ways of boosting collaboration and the sharing of ideas in science.

In 2016, through a series of ‘happy accidents’, Max’s Big Ride was very lucky to be partnered with The Gunning Group Lab at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This chance encounter led to the formation of Max’s Big Fellowship and convinced us of the incredible power of sharing and collaboration. While the research above came about by accident, we hope your ideas - big or small - can help science engineer many more of these chance encounters.

To guide and motivate you in this important work, we will have engaging speakers, structured support, giveaways and cash prizes to help our top teams develop and validate their ideas. First place will walk away with $500, second $250 and third $100!

You will work virtually in teams over two days to brainstorm and design innovative ways of boosting collaboration in science. 
On day three, teams will submit their concepts to a panel of judges - where the top three teams will be selected



1) Drive chance encounters

2) Boost collaboration in Science
- Design challenges that call for interdisciplinary problem solving
